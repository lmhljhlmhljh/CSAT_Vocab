" Finkenauer and Rim investigated the memory of the unexpected death of Belgium s King Baudouin in in a large sample of Belgian citizens The data revealed that the news of the king s death had been widely socially shared By talking about the event people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event At the same time they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place an effect known as flashbulb memory The more an event is socially shared the more it will be fixed in people s minds Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have Naturally people should be driven to forget undesirable events Thus someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened The repetitive social sharing of the bad news contributes to realism Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may even be dismissed as troublemakers extremists or simply weirdos How then do they ever have any influence over the majority The social psychologist Serge Moscovici claims that the answer lies in their behavioural style i e the way the minority gets its point across The crucial factor in the success of the suffragette movement was that its supporters were consistent in their views and this created a considerable degree of social influence Minorities that are active and organised who support and defend their position consistently can create social conflict doubt and uncertainty among members of the majority and ultimately this may lead to social change Such change has often occurred because a minority has converted others to its point of view Without the influence of minorities we would have no innovation no social change Many of what we now regard as major social movements e g Christianity trade unionism or feminism were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective material artefacts mythologies memories and traditions become resources for the present The contents interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present Further heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts It is the former that give value either cultural or financial to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past In turn they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change or even as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents Thus heritage is as much about forgetting as remembering the past The human species is unique in its ability to expand its functionality by inventing new cultural tools Writing arithmetic science all are recent inventions Our brains did not have enough time to evolve for them but I reason that they were made possible because we can mobilize our old areas in novel ways When we learn to read we recycle a specific region of our visual system known as the visual word form area enabling us to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language areas Likewise when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area Even an invention as elementary as finger counting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as say This cultural recycling implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints Biological organisms including human societies both with and without market systems discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives For example the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines where most investment happens before they begin producing may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner and a larger relative proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process and not upfront Thus fossil fuels particularly oil and natural gas in addition to having energy quality advantages cost storability transportability etc over many renewable technologies also have a temporal advantage after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumption return Due to the fact that people tend to favor more immediate outputs fossil fuels are more competitive than renewable energy alternatives in regards to the distance between inputs and outputs Apocalypse Now a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola gained widespread popularity and for good reason The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad s novel Heart of Darkness which is set in the African Congo at the end of the th century Unlike the original novel Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War The setting time period dialogue and other incidental details are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness Both describe a physical journey reflecting the central character s mental and spiritual journey down a river to confront the deranged Kurtz character who represents the worst aspects of civilisation By giving Apocalypse Now a setting that was contemporary at the time of its release audiences were able to experience and identify with its themes more easily than they would have if the film had been a literal adaptation of the novel How many of the lunches that you ate over the last week can you recall Do you remember what you ate today I hope so Yesterday I bet it takes a moment s effort And what about the day before yesterday What about a week ago It s not so much that your memory of last week s lunch has disappeared if provided with the right cue like where you ate it or whom you ate it with you would likely recall what had been on your plate Rather it s difficult to remember last week s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all the other lunches you ve ever eaten as just another lunch When we try to recall something from a category that includes as many instances as lunch or wine many memories compete for our attention The memory of last Wednesday s lunch isn t necessarily gone it s that you lack the right hook to pull it out of a sea of lunchtime memories But a wine that talks That s unique It s a memory without rivals In the less developed world the percentage of the population involved in agriculture is declining but at the same time those remaining in agriculture are not benefiting from technological advances The typical scenario in the less developed world is one in which a very few commercial agriculturalists are technologically advanced while the vast majority are incapable of competing Indeed this vast majority have lost control over their own production because of larger global causes As an example in Kenya farmers are actively encouraged to grow export crops such as tea and coffee at the expense of basic food production The result is that a staple crop such as maize is not being produced in a sufficient amount The essential argument here is that the capitalist mode of production is affecting peasant production in the less developed world in such a way as to limit the production of staple foods thus causing a food problem Over the past years as mechanical processes have replicated behaviors and talents we thought were unique to humans we ve had to change our minds about what sets us apart As we invent more species of AI we will be forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique about humans Each step of surrender we are not the only mind that can play chess fly a plane make music or invent a mathematical law will be painful and sad We ll spend the next three decades indeed perhaps the next century in a permanent identity crisis continually asking ourselves what humans are good for If we aren t unique toolmakers or artists or moral ethicists then what if anything makes us special In the grandest irony of all the greatest benefit of an everyday utilitarian AI will not be increased productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of doing science although all those will happen The greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity Time spent on on line interaction with members of one s own preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people If physicists for example were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area they would likely devote less time and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas In this regard even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today s distributed virtual archives because it seems difficult to use the available search engines to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelf search of an extensive library collection Focusing on on line interaction with people who are engaged in the same specialized area can limit potential sources of information and thus make it less probable for unexpected findings to happen In one sense every character you create will be yourself You ve never murdered but your murderer s rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade even though the circumstances are totally different and you re not even consciously thinking about your middle school years Our characters emotions after all draw on our own emotions Sometimes however you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction dramatizing actual incidents Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself The problem with this and it is a very large problem is that almost no one can view himself objectively on the page As the writer you re too close to your own complicated makeup It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you In fact that s what authors largely have done You can still of course incorporate aspects of yourself your love of Beethoven your quick temper your soccer injuries But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation by definition did not have The creativity that children possess needs to be cultivated throughout their development Research suggests that overstructuring the child s environment may actually limit creative and academic development This is a central problem with much of science instruction The exercises or activities are devised to eliminate different options and to focus on predetermined results The answers are structured to fit the course assessments and the wonder of science is lost along with cognitive intrigue We define cognitive intrigue as the wonder that stimulates and intrinsically motivates an individual to voluntarily engage in an activity The loss of cognitive intrigue may be initiated by the sole use of play items with predetermined conclusions and reinforced by rote instruction in school This is exemplified by toys games and lessons that are an end in and of themselves and require little of the individual other than to master the planned objective Temporal resolution is particularly interesting in the context of satellite remote sensing The temporal density of remotely sensed imagery is large impressive and growing Satellites are collecting a great deal of imagery as you read this sentence However most applications in geography and environmental studies do not require extremely fine grained temporal resolution Meteorologists may require visible infrared and radar information at sub hourly temporal resolution urban planners might require imagery at monthly or annual resolution and transportation planners may not need any time series information at all for some applications Again the temporal resolution of imagery used should meet the requirements of your inquiry Sometimes researchers have to search archives of aerial photographs to get information from that past that pre date the collection of satellite imagery Grief is unpleasant Would one not then be better off without it altogether Why accept it even when the loss is real Perhaps we should say of it what Spinoza said of regret that whoever feels it is twice unhappy or twice helpless Laurence Thomas has suggested that the utility of negative sentiments emotions like grief guilt resentment and anger which there is seemingly a reason to believe we might be better off without lies in their providing a kind of guarantee of authenticity for such dispositional sentiments as love and respect No occurrent feelings of love and respect need to be present throughout the period in which it is true that one loves or respects One might therefore sometimes suspect in the absence of the positive occurrent feelings that one no longer loves At such times negative emotions like grief offer a kind of testimonial to the authenticity of love or respect Over a period of time the buildings which housed social legal religious and other rituals evolved into forms that we subsequently have come to recognize and associate with those buildings function This is a two way process the building provides the physical environment and setting for a particular social ritual such as traveling by train or going to the theater as well as the symbolic setting The meaning of buildings evolves and becomes established by experience and we in turn read our experience into buildings Buildings arouse an empathetic reaction in us through these projected experiences and the strength of these reactions is determined by our culture our beliefs and our expectations They tell stories for their form and spatial organization give us hints about how they should be used Their physical layout encourages some uses and inhibits others we do not go backstage in a theater unless especially invited Inside a law court the precise location of those involved in the legal process is an integral part of the design and an essential part of ensuring that the law is upheld The impacts of tourism on the environment are evident to scientists but not all residents attribute environmental damage to tourism Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas improves the quality of the roads and public facilities and does not contribute to ecological decline Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems overcrowded outdoor recreation or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks Alternatively some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing hunting and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion Some studies suggest that variations in residents feelings about tourism s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions Residents do not weigh tourism s environmental influences identically since they take dissimilar postures based on factors such as the type of tourism opinions on the degree of protection and their distance from an attraction Duration refers to the time that events last If we think of tempo as the speed of events then duration is the speed of the clock itself For the physicist the duration of a second is precise and unambiguous it is equal to cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium In the realm of psychological experience however quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation When people are removed from the cues of real time be it the sun bodily fatigue or timepieces themselves it doesn t take long before their time sense breaks down And it is this usually imprecise psychological clock as opposed to the time on one s watch that creates the perception of duration that people experience Theoretically a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo Imagine for example that baseballs are pitched to two different batters The balls are thrown every seconds for seconds so a total of balls are thrown We now ask both batters how much time has passed Let s say that batter number one who loves hitting feels the duration to be seconds Batter number two bored by baseball believes it to be seconds Psychologically then the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds The perceived tempo in other words is faster for batter number one When two cultures come into contact they do not exchange every cultural item If that were the case there would be no cultural differences in the world today Instead only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from one culture to another Which cultural item is accepted depends largely on the item s use and compatibility with already existing cultural traits For example it is not likely that men s hair dyes designed to get out the gray will spread into parts of rural Africa where a person s status is elevated with advancing years Even when an innovation is consistent with a society s needs there is still no guarantee that it will be accepted For example most people in the United States using US customary units e g inch foot yard mile etc have resisted adopting the metric system even though making such a change would enable US citizens to interface with the rest of the world more efficiently Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into our biology Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as bad and to sweet up to a point as good In many situations however the boundary between good and bad is a reference point that changes over time and depends on the immediate circumstances Imagine that you are out in the country on a cold night inadequately dressed for the pouring rain your clothes soaked A stinging cold wind completes your misery As you wander around you find a large rock that provides some shelter from the fury of the elements The biologist Michel Cabanac would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable because it functions as pleasure normally does to indicate the direction of a biologically significant improvement of circumstances The pleasant relief will not last very long of course and you will soon be shivering behind the rock again driven by your renewed suffering to seek better shelter Research and development for seed improvement has long been a public domain and government activity for the common good However private capital started to flow into seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the seed s nature its role as means of production and its role as product This process gained pace after the invention of hybrid breeding of maize in the late s Today most maize seed cultivated are hybrids The companies that sell them are able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers and the grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and replanting The combination guarantees that farmers will have to buy more seed from the company each season In the s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to create a growing market for private seed companies Long before Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass poets had addressed themselves to fame Horace Petrarch Shakespeare Milton and Keats all hoped that poetic greatness would grant them a kind of earthly immortality Whitman held a similar faith that for centuries the world would value his poems But to this ancient desire to live forever on the page he added a new sense of fame Readers would not simply attend to the poet s work they would be attracted to the greatness of his personality They would see in his poems a vibrant cultural performance an individual springing from the book with tremendous charisma and appeal Out of the political rallies and electoral parades that marked Jacksonian America Whitman defined poetic fame in relation to the crowd Other poets might look for their inspiration from the goddess of poetry Whitman s poet sought the approval of his contemporaries In the instability of American democracy fame would be dependent on celebrity on the degree to which the people rejoiced in the poet and his work Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control There can be broad influential factors sometimes of an economic nature that hold down the performance of everyone being judged One example is in sales If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year sales could be down for example by an average of This actually figure would then represent average performance Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a drop in sales over the previous year Thus good performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group In performance evaluation we should consider contextual factors affecting the individual s performance rather than rely on figures only We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use Of course the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge In the middle of the th century Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were He answered Madam what good is a baby Of course Faraday s experiments were the beginning of the electronic age Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world transistors vaccines plastics began as basic research Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional Science is the study of nature and as we learn more about how nature works we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us The seemingly impractical knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature Science tells us where we are and what we are and that knowledge is beyond value The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has been studied by psychologists since the s but the term multitasking didn t exist until the s It was used to describe computers not people Back then ten megahertz was so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer s ability to quickly perform many tasks In retrospect they probably made a poor choice for the expression multitasking is inherently deceptive Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource the CPU but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource a person It was a clever turn of phrase that s misleading for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time When they multitask they switch back and forth alternating their attention until both tasks are done The speed with which computers tackle multiple tasks feeds the illusion that everything happens at the same time so comparing computers to humans can be confusing My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not cured the world s ills by abolishing wars and starvation that gross human inequality is still widespread that happiness is not universal My friend made a common mistake a basic misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge Knowledge is amoral not immoral but morality neutral It can be used for any purpose but many people assume it will be used to further their favorite hopes for society and this is the fundamental flaw Knowledge of the world is one thing its uses create a separate issue To be disappointed that our progress in understanding has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate view but to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point There is nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social or moral application According to a renowned French scholar the growth in the size and complexity of human populations was the driving force in the evolution of science Early small communities had to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival their thoughts were focused on food and religion As communities became larger some people had time to reflect and debate They found that they could understand and predict events better if they reduced passion and prejudice replacing these with observation and inference But while a large population may have been necessary in itself it was not sufficient for science to germinate Some empires were big but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together was not beneficial to science just as it was not beneficial to reason The early nurturing and later flowering of science required a large and loosely structured competitive community to support original thought and freewheeling incentive The rise in commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed science to follow reason in seventeenth century Europe New media can be defined by four characteristics simultaneously they are media at the turn of the th and st centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use digital code and hypertext as technical means It follows that their most common alternative names are multimedia interactive media and digital media By using this definition it is easy to identify media as old or new For example traditional television is integrated as it contains images sound and text but it is not interactive or based on digital code The plain old telephone was interactive but not integrated as it only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with digital code In contrast the new medium of interactive television adds interactivity and digital code Additionally the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully digitalized and integrated as they add text pictures or video and they are connected to the Internet Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly established that certain works have certain effects Plato is sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us cowardly the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress such representations Tolstoy is confident that the artist who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those feelings on to us we can no more escape than we could escape an infectious disease In fact however the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes Some people may indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of working out those fantasies in real life Others may be disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence Still others may be left unmoved neither attracted nor disgusted Although Plato and Tolstoy claim that works of art have an avoidable impact on people s feelings the degrees and forms of people s actual responses differ greatly Increased size affects group life in a number of ways There is evidence that larger groups five or six members are more productive than smaller groups two or three members Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups and although they seem to reach less agreement they also show less tension These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal directed since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform In such groups it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result Groups with an even number of members may split into halves This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members one side always has a numerical advantage According to some researchers the number five has special significance Groups of this size usually escape the problems we have just outlined Moreover they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction because of the odd number of members deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur B B Sometimes all the outcomes customers are trying to achieve in one area have a negative effect on other outcomes This is very common when companies are busy listening to the voice of the customer Traveling salespeople for example may say they want a smaller cell phone but they may not have thought about how hard that tiny phone will be to use Carpenters may request a lightweight circular saw without thinking about the fact that it will no longer have the power to get through some of the more difficult jobs When customers make requests for new product features they are usually focused on solving just one problem and are not thinking of how their requested solution will impact other product or service functions In this situation customers request new features but reject the resulting product when they realize the ramifications of their suggestions the added feature turns out to be worthless because of the problems it causes B The success of human beings depends crucially on numbers and connections A few hundred people cannot sustain a sophisticated technology Recall that Australia was colonized years ago by pioneers spreading east from Africa along the shore of Asia The vanguard of such a migration must have been small in number and must have traveled comparatively light The chances are they had only a sample of the technology available to their relatives back at the Red Sea crossing This may explain why Australian aboriginal technology although it developed and elaborated steadily over the ensuing millennia was lacking in so many features of the Old World elastic weapons for example such as bows and catapults were unknown as were ovens It was not that they were primitive or that they had mentally regressed it was that they had arrived with only a subset of technologies and did not have a dense enough population and therefore a large enough collective brain to develop them much further B Policymaking is seen to be more objective when experts play a large role in the creation and implementation of the policy and when utilitarian rationality is the dominant value that guides policy Through the use of the scientific method to determine the facts of any given policy situation the power of social constructions is supposedly diminished and solutions to social problems are discovered in an objective way This process creates an illusion of neutrality and implies a transcendence of the pitfalls and inequalities commonly associated with policymaking From this perspective scientists and professionals emerge as the appropriate experts to be consulted in policymaking while local citizen input and knowledge is often viewed as unnecessary Scientific and professional policy design does not necessarily escape the pitfalls of degenerative politics Scientific and professional expertise often relies on a particular type of knowledge that is limited to utility and rationality considerations This approach to policy typically does not consider values and cultural factors that cannot be measured empirically Scientifically designed policies can serve interests that run counter to the public interest They can reinforce unequal and unjust relationships B Like many errors and biases that seem irrational on the surface auditory looming turns out on closer examination to be pretty smart Animals like rhesus monkeys have evolved the same bias This intentional error functions as an advance warning system manned by the self protection subself providing individuals with a margin of safety when they are confronted with potentially dangerous approaching objects If you spot a rhinoceros or hear an avalanche speeding toward you auditory looming will motivate you to jump out of the way now rather than wait until the last second The evolutionary benefits of immediately getting out of the way of approaching dangers were so strong that natural selection endowed us and other mammals with brains that intentionally see and hear the world inaccurately Although this kind of bias might inhibit economically rational judgment in laboratory tasks it leads us to behave in a deeply rational manner in the real world Being accurate is not always smart B Mathematics will attract those it can attract but it will do nothing to overcome resistance to science Science is universal in principle but in practice it speaks to very few Mathematics may be considered a communication skill of the highest type frictionless so to speak and at the opposite pole from mathematics the fruits of science show the practical benefits of science without the use of words But those fruits are ambivalent Science as science does not speak ideally all scientific concepts are mathematized when scientists communicate with one another and when science displays its products to non scientists it need not and indeed is not able to resort to salesmanship When science speaks to others it is no longer science and the scientist becomes or has to hire a publicist who dilutes the exactness of mathematics In doing so the scientist reverses his drive toward mathematical exactness in favor of rhetorical vagueness and metaphor thus violating the code of intellectual conduct that defines him as a scientist B F Scott Fitzgerald thought that the test of first rate intelligence was the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still function The eons shaped our brains in the opposite direction Confirmation bias is a term for the way the mind systematically avoids confronting contradiction It does this by overvaluing evidence that confirms what we already think or feel and undervaluing or simply disregarding evidence that refutes it Testimony from members of the Crow tribe about the destruction of their culture provides an extreme and tragic example of this A man named Plenty Coups reported that when the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground and they could not lift them up again After this nothing happened He was not alone in describing the depth of despair as the end of history Nothing happened after that another Crow warrior said We just lived The emotion was so strong that the brain rejected evidence of the continued existence of normal everyday life that might have eased it B Oil and gas resources are not likely to be impacted by climate change because they result from a process that takes millions of years and are geologically trapped On the other hand climate change may not only force the shutting down of oiland gas producing areas but increase the possibility of exploration in areas of the Arctic through the reduction in ice cover Thus while climate change may not impact these resources oil and gas reserves and known or potential resources could be affected by new climate conditions since climate change may affect access to these resources In Siberia for instance the actual exploration challenge is the time required to access produce and deliver oil under extreme environmental conditions where temperatures in January range from to Warming may ease extreme environmental conditions expanding the production frontier B Low balling describes the technique where two individuals arrive at an agreement and then one increases the cost to be incurred by the other For example after the consumer has agreed to purchase a car for the salesperson begins to add on for tax and for tires These additional costs might be thought of as a metaphorical low ball that the salesperson throws the consumer One explanation for the effectiveness of low balling is in terms of self perception theory When the consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original terms that behavior might be used by the consumer to infer his sincere interest in the product This inferred sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure the increased cost An alternative explanation is in terms of impression management theory If the consumer were to withdraw from the deal after the slight change in the terms of agreement he might foster the rather undesirable impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of these necessary charges Low balling is effective in sales contexts because the consumer by not withdrawing from the deal tends to justify his purchase decision or tries to save face A A In all cultures in which eye gaze behavior has been studied science confirms that those who are dominant have more freedom in using it In essence these individuals are entitled to look wherever they want However subordinates are more restricted in where they can look and when Humility dictates that in the presence of royalty as in church heads are bowed As a general rule dominants tend to ignore subordinates visually while subordinates tend to gaze at dominant individuals at a distance In other words higher status individuals can be indifferent while lower status persons are required to be attentive with their gaze The king is free to look at anyone he wants but all subjects face the king even as they back out of a room A The importance of science has led people to think that objectivity is the best way to see the world to see the facts without any feelings However from a human point of view objectivity is just another attitude It is an interpretation that deliberately ignores our feelings It is very useful to ensure that scientific measurements are taken accurately and so on but as far as life is concerned it is a bit like turning the color off on your TV so that you see everything in black and white and then saying that is more truthful It is not more truthful it is just a filter that reduces the richness of life When you turn down the feelings you also turn down the possibility of enjoyment A Sometimes all the outcomes customers are trying to achieve in one area have a negative effect on other outcomes This is very common when companies are busy listening to the voice of the customer Traveling salespeople for example may say they want a smaller cell phone but they may not have thought about how hard that tiny phone will be to use Carpenters may request a lightweight circular saw without thinking about the fact that it will no longer have the power to get through some of the more difficult jobs When customers make requests for new product features they are usually focused on solving just one problem and are not thinking of how their requested solution will impact other product or service functions In this situation customers request new features but reject the resulting product when they realize the ramifications of their suggestions the added feature turns out to be worthless because of the problems it causes A Self monitoring refers to how much people try to control the way they present themselves to others Those who have high self monitoring want their behavior to be socially acceptable They adjust themselves to any social signal that indicates appropriate or inappropriate behavior For example if they are in a meeting and see others making suggestions they will try to make suggestions as well They are also good at managing what others think about them In contrast those who have low self monitoring are not very sensitive to signals indicating socially acceptable behavior They are not too concerned about behaving the right way in a specific context For example if they are in a meeting with the president of an organization they may act bored They are not deeply concerned about how others see them A It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others It is not just the size of the park that matters Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences and players know this So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one say percent better One analysis found that the player hit percent more home runs Why The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is If you think you are likely to hit more home runs you are more likely to swing for the fences But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base In business and life just as in baseball our perceptions can affect whether we swing for the fences or not The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be Consider your work and your current life Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier To say that we need to curb anger and our negative thoughts and emotions does not mean that we should deny our feelings There is an important distinction to be made between denial and restraint The latter constitutes a deliberate and voluntarily adopted discipline based on an appreciation of the benefits of doing so This is very different from the case of someone who suppresses emotions such as anger out of a feeling that they need to present a facade of self control or out of fear of what others may think Such behaviour is like closing a wound which is still infected We are not talking about rule following Where denial and suppression occur there comes the danger that in doing so the individual stores up anger and resentment The trouble here is that at some future point they may find they cannot contain these feelings any longer Have you ever heard anyone say of a dog Well he s very successful and lives in a beautiful house but he s not very happy One reason most dogs are much happier than most people is that dogs aren t affected by external circumstances the way we are I notice that even when it s pouring rain outside my dogs Blue and Celeste are still excited to go for a walk As soon as I open the front door to look outside they re beside me in a flash standing expectantly ready for an adventure I usually wait for a break in the downpour and then we all dash out together The fact that the ground is wet and there are mud puddles dotting the landscape means nothing to the dogs While I m carefully picking my way around the wet spots the dogs are joyfully splashing right through them They aren t afraid to get their paws dirty In Belding s ground squirrels males leave home and females mature in their natal area This male biased dispersal creates an imbalance in the way males and females are related to those individuals around them females find themselves surrounded by relatives while males are generally in areas with complete strangers This asymmetry translates into females who warn close kin by emitting alarm calls while males generally do not emit calls since their dispersal from their natal areas means their blood kin typically do not benefit from such a warning Further support for the kinship based alarm calling hypothesis includes Sherman s finding that in the rare instances when females do move away from their natal groups and into groups with far fewer relatives they emit alarm calls less frequently than do native females By likening the eye to a camera elementary biology textbooks help to produce a misleading impression of what perception entails Only in terms of the physics of image formation do the eye and camera have anything in common Both eye and camera have a lens that focuses light rays from the outside world into an image and both have a means of adjusting the focus and brightness of that image Both eye and camera have a light sensitive layer onto which the image is cast the retina and film respectively However image formation is only the first step towards seeing Superficial analogies between the eye and a camera obscure the much more fundamental difference between the two which is that the camera merely records an image whereas the visual system interprets it Recent evidence suggests that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern people living about years ago may have already been using pretty sophisticated language If language is based on genes and is the key to cultural evolution and Neanderthals had language then why did the Neanderthal toolkit show so little cultural change Moreover genes would undoubtedly have changed during the human revolution after years ago but more in response to new habits than as causes of them At an earlier date cooking selected mutations for smaller guts and mouths rather than vice versa At a later date milk drinking selected for mutations for retaining lactose digestion into adulthood in people of western European and East African descent The cultural horse comes before the genetic cart The appeal to a genetic change driving evolution gets gene culture co evolution backwards it is a top down explanation for a bottom up process To describe what happens to common resources as a result of human greed Garrett Hardin used the example of an area of pasture on which all the cattle owners are permitted to graze their animals free of charge Each cattle owner seeks to maximize his gain and in doing so considers the relative advantage and disadvantage of adding one more animal to the herd The advantage is that the cattle owner receives the whole of the profit from the sale of the additional animal The disadvantage is that the extra grazing contributes to the deterioration of the pasture However the disadvantage is shared among all the cattle owners using the pasture so the individual owner suffers only a fraction of the disadvantage Consequently the advantage is bound to exceed the disadvantage Thus it is inevitable that more and more animals will be brought onto the pasture until overgrazing totally destroys the pasture In physics scientists invent models or theories to describe and predict the data we observe about the universe Newton s theory of gravity is one example Einstein s theory of gravity is another Those theories though they describe the same phenomenon constitute very different versions of reality Newton for example imagined that masses affect each other by exerting a force while in Einstein s theory the effects occur through a bending of space and time and there is no concept of gravity as a force Either theory could be employed to describe with great accuracy the falling of an apple but Newton s would be much easier to use On the other hand for the calculations necessary for the satellite based global positioning system GPS that helps you navigate while driving Newton s theory would give the wrong answer and so Einstein s must be used Why in country after country that mandated seat belts was it impossible to see the promised reduction in road accident fatalities John Adams professor of geography at University College London wrote in one of his many essays on risk It appears that measures that protect drivers from the consequences of bad driving encourage bad driving The principal effect of seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of risk from those already best protected in cars to the most vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists outside cars Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings under the concept of risk compensation the idea that humans have an inborn tolerance for risk As safety features are added to vehicles and roads drivers feel less vulnerable and tend to take more chances The phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily lives Children who wear protective gear during their games have a tendency to take more physical risks Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can access them easily According to John Adams the phenomenon that safety measures contribute tocareless driving may be accounted for by the notion that a greater sense of security tempts people to take more risks What should writers do when they re teased by intriguing but elusive ideas by hints of thoughts that seem too vague to be expressed in words Edgar Allan Poe s advice is simple They should pick up their pens or he might add today power up their laptops Poe dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or subtle that they re beyond the compass of words For my own part he said in an article in Graham s Magazine I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it The mere act of writing Poe believed helps writers make their ideas not only clearer but more logical To use his phrase the process of writing contributes to the logicalization of thought Whenever he felt dissatisfied with a vague conception of the brain Poe said I resort forthwith to the pen for the purpose of obtaining through its aid the necessary form consequence and precision Today s advocates of freewriting would probably agree with Poe on this point Sometimes the best way to resolve a dilemma whether it s a writing dilemma or a thinking dilemma is simply to start writing What you do in the to minutes after eating your evening meal sends powerful signals to your metabolism You ll set the stage for more vigor throughout the evening hours along with a weight loss benefit if you stay active after your meal Among many possible activities walking is one of the easiest ways to get some minutes of exercise after a meal In fact research shows that if you walk after a meal you may burn percent more calories than if you walk the same time distance and intensity on an empty stomach Interestingly people are more overconfident when they feel like they have control of the outcome even when this is clearly not the case For example it is documented that if people are asked to bet on whether a coin toss is heads or tails most bet larger amounts if the coin is yet to be tossed If the coin is tossed and the outcome is concealed people will offer lower amounts when asked for bets People act as if their involvement will somehow affect the outcome of the toss In this case control of the outcome is clearly an illusion This perception occurs in investing as well Even without information people believe the stocks they own will perform better than stocks they do not own However ownership of a stock only gives the illusion of having control of the performance of the stock The truth is that everyone has a story Every person we meet has a story that can in some way inform us and help us as we live the story of our own lives When we acknowledge this truth and begin to look at others as potential sources of valuable information we open ourselves up to new possibilities in our lives In reality the people who are most different from us probably have the most to teach us The more we surround ourselves with people who are the same as we are who hold the same views and who share the same values the greater the likelihood that we will shrink as human beings rather than grow Although there are numerous explanations for the fall of the Roman empire the deeper cause lies in the declining fertility of its soil and the decrease in agricultural yields Italy was densely forested at the beginning of Roman rule By the end of the Roman Imperium however Italy had been stripped of forest cover The timber was sold on the open market and the soil converted to crops and pastureland The cleared soil was rich in minerals and nutrients and provided substantial production yields Unfortunately deforestation left the soil exposed to harsh weather Wind blew across the barren landscapes and water ran down from the mountaintops and slopes taking the soil with them Overgrazing of livestock resulted in further deterioration of the soil Consequently Rome s agricultural production could not provide sufficient energy to maintain its infrastructure and the welfare of its citizens The identical claim expressed in two social contexts may have different qualifiers When talking among friends you might say Luc is the world s finest restaurant When speaking to a group of French chefs you might find yourself saying Luc is an excellent restaurant comparable to some of the best in France Why did you say it differently Perhaps because you expected a different critical scrutiny in the two groups Maybe because your confidence in the claim was strong enough for friends but not as strong among the most knowledgeable In each instance you communicated the extent to which you wanted to qualify your claim to guard yourself by restricting the extent to which you are willing to be held accountable for the claim Often in social scientific practice even where evidence is used it is not used in the correct way for adequate scientific testing In much of social science evidence is used only to affirm a particular theory to search for the positive instances that uphold it But these are easy to find and lead to the familiar dilemma in the social sciences where we have two conflicting theories each of which can claim positive empirical evidence in its support but which come to opposite conclusions How should we decide between them Here the scientific use of evidence may help For what is distinctive about science is the search for negative instances the search for ways to falsify a theory rather than to confirm it The real power of scientific testability is negative not positive Testing allows us not merely to confirm our theories but to weed out those that do not fit the evidence The term euphemism derives from a Greek word meaning to speak with good words and involves substituting a more pleasant less objectionable way of saying something for a blunt or more direct way Why do people use euphemisms They do so probably to help smooth out the rough edges of life to make the unbearable bearable and the offensive inoffensive However euphemisms can become dangerous when they are used to create misperceptions of important issues For example a politician may indicate that one of his statements was somewhat at variance with the truth meaning that he lied Even more serious examples include describing rotting slums as substandard housing making the miserable conditions appear reasonable and the need for action less important Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties rather than taking up the case of one party against another At times particularly in very complex situations the processes of advocacy and mediation can overlap perhaps with very problematic results as one loses clarity over his or her role It is therefore important if not essential to maintain a clear focus in undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure that the roles do not become blurred and therefore potentially counterproductive For example a mediator who takes sides is likely to lose all credibility as is an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position Although both deal with negotiation a mediator needs to maintain neutrality and an advocate partiality in order to avoid crossing over into each other s role Since the beginning of time the mysterious nature of dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were messages from the other world Dreams have been regarded as prophetic communications which when properly decoded would enable us to foretell the future There is however absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory It is certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a traumatic event such as the threat of the loss of a loved one who is sick will dream about that loved one more than would otherwise be the case If the dreamer then calls and finds that the loved one has died it is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition of that death But this is a mistake It is simply a n correspondence between a situation about coincidental which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the event that one fears To prove the existence of premonitory dreams scientific evidence must be obtained We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of hits but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams missed To do a scientific study of dream prophecy we would need to establish some base of how commonly coincidental correspondences occur between dream and waking reality Until we have that evidence it is better to believe that the assumption is false In a classic set of studies over a ten year period biologist Gerald Wilkinson found that when vampire bats return to their communal nests from a successful night s foraging they frequently vomit blood and share it with other nest mates including even non relatives The reason it turns out is that blood sharing greatly improves each bat s chances of survival A bat that fails to feed for two nights is likely to die Wilkinson showed that the blood donors are typically sharing their surpluses and in so doing are saving unsuccessful foragers that are close to starvation So the costs are relatively low and the benefits are relatively high Since no bat can be certain of success on any given night it is likely that the donor will itself eventually need help from some nest mate In effect the vampire bats have created a kind of mutual insurance system One of the little understood paradoxes in communication is that the more difficult the word the shorter the explanation The more meaning you can pack into a single word the fewer words are needed to get the idea across Big words are resented by persons who don t understand them and of course very often they are used to confuse and impress rather than clarify But this is not the fault of language it is the arrogance of the individual who misuses the tools of communication The best reason for acquiring a large vocabulary is that it keeps you from being long winded A genuinely educated person can express himself tersely and trimly For example if you don t know or use the word imbricate you have to say to someone having the edges overlapping in a regular arrangement like tiles on a roof scales on a fish or sepals on a plant More than words to say what can be said in one So far as you are wholly concentrated on bringing about a certain result clearly the quicker and easier it is brought about the better Your resolve to secure a sufficiency of food for yourself and your family will induce you to spend weary days in tilling the ground and tending livestock but if Nature provided food and meat in abundance ready for the table you would thank Nature for sparing you much labor and consider yourself so much the better off An executed purpose in short is a transaction in which the time and energy spent on the execution are balanced against the resulting assets and the ideal case is one in which the former approximates to zero and the latter to infinity Purpose then justifies the efforts it exacts only conditionally by their fruits Psychologist Solomon Asch wanted to discover whether people s tendency to agree with their peers was stronger than their tendency toward independent thought and rational judgment Asch assembled groups of twelve university students and announced that they were taking part in an experiment on visual perception He showed them three line segments and asked each one in turn which line was the longest It was an easy task and the correct answer was obvious However Asch had secretly instructed all but the last person in each group who was the real subject of the experiment to say that the medium length line was the longest As it turned out over percent of the real subjects caved in to group pressure and said that the medium length line was the longest Journeys are the midwives of thought Few places are more conducive to internal conversations than a moving plane ship or train There is an almost peculiar correlation between what is in front of our eyes and the thoughts we are able to have in our heads large thoughts at times requiring large views new thoughts new places Introspective reflections which are liable to stall are helped along by the flow of the landscape The mind may be reluctant to think properly when thinking is all it is supposed to do The task can be as paralyzing as having to tell a joke or mimic an accent on demand Thinking improves when parts of the mind are given other tasks are charged with listening to music or following a line of trees It is a fundamental mistake to imagine that when we see the non value in a value or the untruth in a truth the value or the truth ceases to exist It has only become relative Everything human is relative because everything rests on an inner polarity for everything is a phenomenon of energy Energy necessarily depends on a pre existing polarity without which there could be no energy There must always be high and low hot and cold etc so that the equilibrating process which is energy can take place Therefore the tendency to deny all previous values in favor of their opposites is just as much of an exaggeration as the earlier onesidedness And in so far as it is a question of rejecting universally accepted and indubitable values the result is a fatal loss No matter how good your product is remember that perfection of an existing product is not necessarily the best investment one can make For example the Erie Canal which took four years to build was regarded as the height of efficiency in its day What its builders had not considered was that the advent of the railroad would assure the canal s instant downfall By the time the canal was finished the railroad had been established as the fittest technology for transportation Likewise when the fuel cell becomes the automotive engine of choice the car companies focusing on increasing the efficiency of the internal combustion engine may find themselves left behind Is it time to keep making what you are making Or is it time to create a new niche Innovation requires noticing signals outside the company itself signals in the community the environment and the world at large Unlike the modern society the primitive society has less specialized knowledge to transmit and since its way of life is enacted before the eyes of all it has no need to create a separate institution of education such as the school Instead the child acquires the heritage of his culture by observing and imitating adults in such activities as rituals hunts festivals cultivation and harvesting As a result there is little or none of that alienation of young from old so marked in modern industrial societies A further reason for this alienation in modern societies is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes less to his direct experience and more to the experience of his culture than does primitive man Clearly his debt to culture will vary with the nature of his education Hence the contemporary child must travel much further than the offspring of primitive man to acquire the world view of his elders He is therefore that much more removed from the adults of his society Unlike the primitive child who learns from his immediate surroundings the modern child learns in educational institutions which results in alienation from his elders Many people believe that it is critical to share similar if not identical beliefs and values with someone with whom they have a relationship While this may seem preferable it is far from mandatory Individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds have learned to overlook their differences and live harmonious loving lives together I ve seen people from opposite ends of the spectrum economically and politically that ended up in happy lasting marriages I ve seen couples from different ethnic groups merge into harmonious relationships and I ve seen people from different religions come together for a strong lasting bond Furthermore many good friends have little in common except a warm loving feeling of respect and rapport That s the only essential thing People who enjoy the best relationships with others who live life with the least frustration regarding their differences have learned that differences are to be expected a fact of life This understanding must go beyond a mere intellectual I know we re all different You must truly own this idea and incorporate it into your daily life The way I see it we have only two realistic choices We can resist the principle of separate realities and remain frustrated and angry over the fact that no one seems to conform to our way of thinking or we can strive to understand what in Eastern philosophy is called the way of things Separate realities is the way things really are Everyone is unique and has different gifts to offer When we look for these gifts we will surely find them and in doing so we will open the door to a world of personal growth In this modern world people are not used to living with discomfort We expect immediate results and satisfaction We want answers faster than they can be delivered There is twenty four hour repair and round the clock shopping If we are hungry there is always food available from microwave dinners to all night grocery stores and restaurants People no longer know how to wait or even what waiting means It is nice to have what you want when you want it but the ability to delay satisfaction is important Patience is clearly an important virtue yet so many people stand in front of their microwaves thinking Hurry up The goal of medicine as it is currently practiced is to develop procedures and drugs that work equally well on all patients regardless of gender age or genetics It derives from the prevalent belief that all of us are similar bio mechanical units that rolled off the same assembly line a most imperfect conception of human beings that limits conventional medicine s effectiveness The doctor of the future however needs to practice medicine in fundamentally different ways One of the most important shifts will be an increased recognition of patient individuality a concept now largely ignored Instead of treating different patients that display similar symptoms with the same drugs doctors should identify root causes of disease to come up with a personalized treatment For the most part we like things that are familiar to us To prove the point to yourself try a little experiment Get the negative of an old photograph that shows a front view of your face and have it developed into a pair of pictures one that shows you as you actually look and one that shows a reverse image so that the right and left sides of your face are interchanged Now decide which version of your face you like better and ask a good friend to make the choice too If you are like most people you should notice something odd Your friend will prefer the true print but you will prefer the reverse image Why Because you both will be responding favorably to the more familiar face your friend to the one the world sees and you to the reversed one you find in the mirror every day The human auditory system has its own version of perceptual completion A psychologist named Richard Warren demonstrated this particularly well He recorded a sentence and cut out a piece of the sentence from the recording tape He replaced the missing piece with a burst of static of the same duration Nearly everyone who heard the altered recording could report that they heard both a sentence and static But a majority of people could not tell where the static was The auditory system had filled in the missing speech information so that the sentence seemed uninterrupted Most people reported that there was static and that it existed apart from the spoken sentence The static and the sentence formed separate perceptual streams due to differences in the quality of sound that caused them to group separately Not all authors trusted that the theater audience would automatically understand their plays in the intended manner Thus they repeatedly attempted to make it clear to their public that visiting the theater was not merely for the purpose of entertainment but rather to draw lessons from the play offered onstage It was therefore important for the viewer to create a distance from the actions on the stage so as to facilitate interpretation of the content This idea was developed by Bertolt Brecht with his epic theater which used alienation as a strategy to prevent the identification of the public with the figures of the drama Through scattered narration and commentary throughout the play for example the viewers are invited to take a step back from the performance In this way they are given hints to better understand the play while the conclusion is left open so as to leave them to draw their own conclusions Many years ago psychologists performed an experiment in which they put a number of people in a room alone except for a ring toss set It was one of those children s toys with a short wooden post held upright on the floor and a bunch of round rings The subjects were left alone to amuse themselves as best they could As expected with time to kill they began trying to toss the rings around the post What the psychologists discovered was that most of the people moved far enough away from the post so that tossing the rings around it was challenging but not so difficult as to be totally frustrating In other words they deliberately positioned themselves between frustration on the one hand and boredom on the other The process of alternately producing and relieving tension was what made the activity stimulating Subjects tended to make a ring toss activity stimulating by producing just enough tension through varying the distance to the post so as to balance frustration and boredom On the wall of our dining room was a framed quotation Let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man It inspired in me countless childhood daydreams about meeting new people from exotic places I was a child who desperately wanted to connect with others We did live by the side of the road on Route between Keene and Portsmouth but in a place so remote it was extremely difficult to be a friend to man One day when our family drove into town I focused intently on the big paper grocery store signs advertising the same type of produce that we grew carrots cents a bunch tomatoes cents a pound Meanwhile I thought of how the type of imperfect produce we ate for dinner just as healthy as that sold at the store was often tossed on the compost heap or left in the ground The unattractive produce such as crooked carrots and odd looking tomatoes was not valuable to the grocery store where only perfect produce was sold But I knew they would have value to people who would chop them into salads or soups can them or use them to make pies because that is what our family did with them They were fresh and clean and came straight from the good earth Why couldn t others also benefit from that value I could save people the trouble of going into the store by making my produce accessible at the side of the road and that would provide value too Surely I could convince people to pay half of what the grocery store charged and to feel lucky about the bargain Suddenly I saw a connection between those bumpy vegetables on our table and the quotation on the wall I found a way to satisfy my longing for new friends These homely fruits and vegetables would become my golden apples A friend of mine and his wife were in Hawaii standing on a beach watching a beautiful sunset hardly able to believe how magnificent the sight was A woman approached them and overheard my friend s wife say I can t believe how beautiful this is While walking away from the spectacular display the woman said You should have seen it in Tahiti When your attention is not on the present moment but on something else you will tend to compare even good experiences with others as the Tahiti traveler did or you will wonder about future experiences instead of enjoying the present one and regret past experiences because they are already over But as you learn to bring your attention back to the here and now life will come alive again providing the enjoyment and satisfaction it was meant to Thus when you live in the present moment one of the nice things that happens to you is that ordinary everyday life takes on a new significance Taking walks watching a sunset gardening reading a book all begin to feel special When your attention is brought back to the here and now you engage in life rather than think about life While the fine art object is valued because it is unique it is also valued because it can be reproduced for popular consumption For example Van Gogh s paintings have been reproduced endlessly on posters postcards coffee mugs and T shirts Ordinary consumers can own a copy of the highly valued originals Therefore the value of the original results not only from its uniqueness but from its being the source from which reproductions are made The manufacturers who produce art reproductions and the consumers who purchase and display them give value to the work of art by making it available to many people as an item of popular culture There are some people who believe that no one should be trusted They usually feel this way because their behavior compels others to lie to them In other words they make it difficult for others to tell them the truth because they respond rudely or emotionally to people who tell the truth If others see how angry hurt or hateful you become when they tell you the truth they will avoid telling it to you at all costs If you are known as someone who is easily offended you will never know what others are really thinking or feeling because they will distort the truth to escape from your negative reaction If you demand that children tell you the truth and then punish them because it is not very satisfying you teach them to lie to you to protect themselves One of the main principles I follow when I draw outside is not to select a subject that is too difficult or odd I try to stay away from houses or barns that have unusual angles of the roof or objects that look incorrect in size perspective or design If the subject is confusing when you look at it it will be more confusing when you attempt to draw it I know a beautiful barn where the corners are not at right angles No matter how many times I have drawn it the perspective does not look right If I were to make an accurate drawing of this barn and put it in a show I m sure I would get all kinds of criticism for my poor perspective I would not be there to tell my critics that the barn is actually constructed this way So I stay away from subjects that do not look right to me When faced with things that are too big to sense we comprehend them by adding knowledge to the experience The first appearance of a shining star in a darkening evening sky can take you out into the universe if you combine what you see with the twin facts that the star is merely one of the closest of the galaxy s billion stars and that its light began traveling decades ago The smell of gasoline going into a car s tank during a refueling stop when combined with the fact that each day nearly a billion gallons of crude oil are refined and used in the United States can allow our imagination to spread outward into the vast global network of energy trade and politics Sheets of paper exist almost entirely for the purpose of carrying information so we tend to think of them as neutral objects We rarely interpret marks on paper as references to the paper itself However when we see the text characters and images on artifacts that serve other purposes we generally interpret these marks as labels that do refer to their carriers Natural objects do not come with labels of course but these days most physical artifacts do That is their designers have chosen to shift part of the burden of communication from the form and materials of the artifact itself to lightweight surface symbols So for example a designer of door handles might not worry about communicating their functions through their shapes but might simply mark them push and pull Everywhere in the world the issue of how to manage urban growth poses the highest stakes complex policy decisions and strongly heated conflicts in the public area The contrast between Western Europe and America is particularly sharp In Western Europe steep gasoline taxes investment policies favoring built up areas over undeveloped greenfields continuous investment in public transportation and other policies have produced relatively compact cities Cities in Western Europe tend to be economically healthy compared with their suburbs By contrast in the United States cheap gas massive highway investment policies that favor construction on the edges of cities and heavy reliance on property taxes to fund public schools have encouraged much more car reliant and spread out urban areas where eight in ten Americans now live Different public policies resulted in relatively centralized cities in Western Europe but resulted in spread out urban areas in the United States Some scientists have shown the practical power of looking at the world through could be eyes When a group of students were shown an unfamiliar rubbery object and told This could be a dog s chewy toy they were later able to see that it might also be of use as an eraser when they made some pencil mistakes In contrast students who were told that it was a dog s chewy toy did not find its alternative use Another group of students watched a video about physics after being told This presents only one of several outlooks on physics Please feel free to use any additional methods you want to assist you in solving the problems On tests of factual comprehension these students performed no differently from students who had watched the video with a different introduction This presents the outlook on physics Please use the method you see in the video in solving the problems But when they were faced with questions that asked them to use the information more creatively the could be students performed much better than the others Just a simple change of language seemed to invite the students to process and store information in a much more flexible format and thus be able to look at it and make use of it in different ways A clean sheet of paper is lying in front of you and you have to fill it up Suddenly your mind may seem as blank as the paper What can you do to set your pen in motion The answer is simple Don t be caught in the perfection trap That is if you can convince yourself that the first draft isn t your best writing and can be made more effective with additional thought and some revision then it will be easier to get started When starting don t worry about what the reader will think about what you have written Make writing as easy for you as you can by not being concerned with how good the first draft is There will be time for revising and polishing any ideas you want to pursue later When people began to bind books with pages that could be turned rather than unrolled like papyrus the process of locating information changed Now the reader could easily move backward in the text to find a previously read passage or browse between widely separated sections of the same work With one technological change cross referencing became possible while the physical space needed to house a collection of books was sharply reduced Page numbers became a possibility as did indexes tables of contents became workable references What is the most prevalent and perhaps most important prefix of our times The answer should be multi which means more than one Our modern jobs are increasingly requiring multi tasking Our communities are getting multi cultural Our entertainment is multi media While detailed knowledge of a single area once guaranteed success today the top rewards go to those who can operate with equal confidence in different realms Let us call these people boundary crossers They develop expertise in multiple areas they speak different languages and they find joy in the rich variety of human experience They live multi lives because that is more interesting and nowadays more effective Night diving is obviously less simple than diving during the day but when properly organized it is relatively straightforward A powerful flashlight will easily light your way and the creatures around you revealing marine life in its true colors However if you cover up your flashlight you will be surprised at how much light there is underwater Many creatures use phosphorescence at night and as you move through the water you will cause plankton to release tiny pulses of light leaving beautiful glowing wakes trailing behind you One key social competence is how well or poorly people express their own feelings Paul Ekman uses the term display rules for the social agreement about which feelings can be properly shown when Cultures sometimes vary tremendously in this regard For example Ekman and his colleagues in an Asian country studied the facial reactions of students to a horrific film about a teenage Aboriginal ritual ceremony When the students watched the film with an authority figure present their faces showed only the slightest hints of reaction However when they thought they were alone though they were being taped by a secret camera their faces twisted into vivid mixes of uncomfortable feelings With the rise of the social sciences and especially the anthropology of the s and thereafter words like savage and primitive began to disappear from the vocabulary of cultural studies along with the notion that the people who had once borne these labels represented a biologically less evolved form of humanity Medical science could find no difference in the brains of the former primitives to account for their different behavior colonists necessarily observed that yesterday s savage might be today s shopkeeper soldier or servant As humanity began to look more like a family of potential equals Westerners had to accept that the behavior found in native cultures was not the distinctive feature of savage otherness but the expression of a capacity that may exist for better or for worse in all of us Westerners came to admit that their view toward the distinctive behavior found in native cultures was biased In ordinary life you can be very comfortable with modern technology Just as people search for books in bookstores you can find and select what you want with a computer You have already seen how much modern technology has changed the world You can talk to each other in real time looking at each other on a palm sized phone In the near future I believe that most people will wear user friendly computer equipment making their daily lives even more convenient This would give us the chance to find information quickly and communicate with others no matter where we are or what we are doing The latest devices are fun to use for many tasks like browsing cyber space but it is important to keep your distance from them as well The constant noises of electronic devices like computers mobile phones fax machines stereos and home appliances will drown out the sounds of the birds singing in the morning the wind blowing through the trees or a pencil drawing on rough paper Modern technology is addictive so be sure to plan days away from its electromagnetic fields Go out into nature and leave your mobile phone behind Or just turn everything off and enjoy the peace and quiet Walking down the street you may not even notice the trees but according to a new study they do a lot more than give shade Environmental scientists chose two Chicago public housing projects both of which had some buildings with lots of trees nearby and some with practically none According to the study violence and property crimes were nearly twice as high in sections of the buildings where vegetation was low compared with the sections where vegetation was high Why One explanation Greenery creates a natural gathering space for neighbors and ultimately stronger bias in the community This can also create an atmosphere where children are better supervised and buildings better watched People tend to stick to their first impressions even if they are wrong Suppose you mention the name of your new neighbor to a friend Oh I know him your friend replies He seems nice at first but it s all an act Perhaps this evaluation is groundless The neighbor may have changed since your friend knew him or perhaps your friend s judgment is simply unfair Whether the judgment is accurate or not once you accept it it will probably influence the way you respond to the neighbor Even if this neighbor were a saint you would be likely to interpret his behavior in ways that fit your expectation A common mistake in talking to celebrities is to assume that they don t know much about anything else except their occupations In fact the movie business and the athletic world are full of intelligent educated and informed men and women who are interested and involved in a wide variety of activities and causes Yet they are asked only about acting or sports If you happen to know about the celebrity s extracurricular interest you might find he or she will speak to you about it much more freely than about his or her professional life For example ask Paul Newman the famous actor about his charity work with kids Upon entering a record store one encounters a wide variety of genres from easy listening to jazz and classical music Jazz and classical music have a number of things in common However they also have a number of differences Before sound recording classical music was passed down through written scores whereas early jazz mainly relied on live performance The composers are in control in classical music they write the musical notes along with detailed instructions In jazz on the contrary the performers often improvise their own melodies In sum classical music and jazz both aim to provide a depth of expression and detail but they achieve their goal through different approaches Design and styling cannot be fully understood outside of their social economic political cultural and technological contexts For example the cycles of Western economies during the th century had a significant impact on the prevalence of objects that emphasized design over styling and the other way round While design and styling are interrelated they are completely distinct fields Styling is concerned with surface treatment and appearance the expressive qualities of a product Design on the other hand is primarily concerned with problem solving the function of a product It generally seeks simplification and essentiality People who run sports camps think of the children first They do their best to create enjoyable and protective environments in which the children feel comfortable and safe Unfortunately some sports coaches in the camps occasionally become over enthusiastic in their desire to help the children excel As a result they put pressure on them to perform at high levels win at all costs and keep playing even when they get hurt This no pain no gain approach is extremely stressful and leads to unnecessary injuries Parents should therefore take care when they send their children to a sports camp and should talk with the sports coaches to see if they will respect the children s wishes In choosing the most suitable sports camp for their children parents should make sure that the coaches have caring attitudes to children Since it manufactured its first car in Korea has grown to be the sixth largest automobile producer in the world It is expected to be among the world s top four auto making countries by after the U S Japan and Germany owing to its competitiveness in small car manufacturing skilled human workforce and leading information technology With an expected production of million units in Korea will hold percent of the global auto market Mathematics definitely influenced Renaissance art Renaissance art was different from the art in the Middle Ages in many ways Prior to the Renaissance obj ects in paintings were flat and symbolic rather than real in appearance Artists during the Renaissance reformed painting They wanted obj ects in paintings to be represented with accuracy Mathematics was used to portray the essential form of obj ects in perspective as they appeared to the human eye Renaissance artists achieved perspective using geometry which resulted in a naturalistic precise three dimensional representation of the real world The application of mathematics to art particularly in paintings was one of the primary characteristics of Renaissance art The number of foreigners interested in the Korean language has increased dramatically over the past few years because of the success of Korean firms overseas and growing interest in Korean culture For example many Chinese students have become interested in Korean as they plan to work for Korean firms which offer better opportunities and pay The total number of foreign students attending Korean language programs has increased to more than in Seoul alone this year from about at the end of last year People speaking Korean have long been limited mostly to those from the peninsula It is no wonder few people ever imagined that the country s language might one day become popular in the international community A long time ago a dissatisfied horse asked the gods for longer thinner legs a neck like a swan and a saddle that would grow upon him Right away the merciful gods changed him into a creature having all the new features But although they had looked attractive separately the entire assembly shocked him for he found that he had been changed into an ugly camel There now said the gods all your wishes are granted and you will now live as you ve wished all your life Remember Not all change is good You should be satisfied with what you have You may have had this experience A person calls you on the telephone Apparently assuming you will recognize her voice she does not provide any verbal content which would help you identify her For example you pick up the phone and say Hello and the voice on the other end says Hi how are you doing At this point you realize you don t know who it is So you try to extend the conversation without admitting your ignorance hoping some verbal clues will be given or that you ll eventually recognize the caller s voice As a result you say something like Fine What have you been up to In the beginning of telephone conversations voice as well as verbal clues plays important roles in identifying callers The adult forgets the troubles of his youth Comparing the remembered carefree past with his immediate problems the mature man thinks that troubles belong only to the present The twelve year old the adult thinks does not worry about salary or professional advancement When the roof leaks only the parent worries about what contractor to employ or about how he will repair it himself To the adult then childhood is a time of freedom The child however wishes always to be a man He finds freedom in the future To him adulthood is a time of wealth and his father or mother never needs to worry about saving to buy a bicycle Happiness is too seldom found in the present it is remembered as a thing of the past or looked forward to as a part of the future Perhaps the greatest thing about being a devoted operagoer is that there is so much room for growth Although you have heard an opera once you can still hear it five or twenty times more I have heard at least twenty performances of my favorite operas and I would happily hear them twenty more times With each rehearing you refine what you know The better you know an opera the more you will be challenged by the ideas of new singers conductors directors and designers Your first experience with Rigoletto and Tosca is only your introduction to those masterpieces Each time you hear a different singer in any of the key roles you are hearing a new interpretation Even the same singer will vary on two different occasions Artists grow and change in their approach to a character based on their own life experiences and their moods For example I saw a famous soprano from Eastern Europe sing Tosca twice within ten months The first time was a good honest performance that pleased the audience The second was impressive Between the performances the singer s husband had suddenly died The love scenes in the second performance seemed much more moving and her response to the death of her lover was undeniably charming Teens surround themselves with imaginary audiences They imagine others are as interested in them as they are in themselves Believing that everyone is watching them teenagers are extremely self conscious A young boy for example may believe that he is unattractive because of his nose Nothing can convince him that other people are paying no attention to his nose at all Also when chatting with friends some teenage girls are too expressive talking and laughing loudly playing to their unreal audiences They gradually realize however that others are not really interested in them Teenagers behavior changes when they realize others are too busy with their own lives to be watching them Professional athletes do not agree on what their roles should be Some star players believe that their role is to be a great player not a role model for young people They insist We re not paid to be role models They strongly believe that what they do in their private lives is their own business On the contrary other star players disagree They maintain that sports stars are role models for people even though they may not want to be They say We do not choose to be role models We are chosen Our choice is whether to be good role models or bad ones Some Korean artists suggest that the process of making hanj i hand made Korean paper reflects human life In fact you might say that people s day to day existence is shown in this paper making process The process starts when the branches of a tree are cut off The branches then go through a complex process to become strong and flexible paper They are steamed boiled and then washed many times to remove any impure materials They are also beaten for several hours The more they are beaten the stronger they actually become This is similar to people getting wiser and more disciplined by overcoming the difficulties and hardships they encounter day after day Different groups develop ideas in different ways In successful groups individuals are encouraged to produce imaginative and original ideas and share them with others In unsuccessful groups individual members are not encouraged to do so Instead they are always asked to do groupthink In the beginning there are no differences in the abilities and qualities among the members of these two kinds of groups However in the end the groups which encourage individual members to think creatively will prosper whereas those which do not will fail Therefore group leaders must learn this lesson and put it into practice in order to achieve productive and positive results Many difficulties and much stress today come from our thinking that there is not enough time Time itself remains unchanged in the sense that it carries on in the same way as it has for millions of years We need to see that it is circumstances that are different and that our increased workloads put too much pressure upon us However most of us try to adjust our attitudes and behaviors to a rapid pace of living and working The secret lies not in finding smart ways to do more but in how we manage the relationship between the things we have to do and the time available to do them in Many people went outside around August this year to observe the close encounter between Earth and Mars On August when Mars was closer to Earth than ever in human history the one way travel time of light was just minutes and seconds Thus if you had turned a light toward Mars that day it would have reached Mars in seconds Mars was so bright that even the lights of the city didn t get in the way If you missed this astronomical show you re really out of luck Mars will not be this close again until the year In making a successful school we must consider the relationships among the people involved in the school community Teachers need to know their students well in order to be able to teach them effectively In addition teachers must maintain a good relationship with the parents who are also an important part of the total community In a community built on trust and openness where teachers students and parents show respect for each other students feel secure and can develop the self confidence which makes learning and personal growth possible When students are drawn into meaningful relationships with their teachers and other adults they are better able to see them as real people This affects their whole attitude toward school and learning In such an environment teachers feel valued and supported Parents feel included As a result they are more likely to contribute to the improvement of the school and the learning of the students All members of the school community feel as though they belong and can make a positive contribution to the school Infrasound is a low pitched sound whose frequency is far below the range of human ears Scientists however have been able to discover the existence of infrasound by using special technologies These new technologies have revealed that many things can produce infrasound from earthquakes and thunderstorms to trains and underground explosions thus making possible the warning of earthquakes and the monitoring of underground nuclear explosion tests These new technologies have another benefit for biologists by allowing them to gain access to the unknown world of communication between animals For centuries biologists believed giraffes were the silent giants of Africa In recent years however biologists have been able to listen more carefully by means of these technologies and have realized that giraffes may talk though not in a way that we can hear Communication through infrasound is not limited to giraffes Over the last few decades biologists have found that whales elephants and some other animals also use this extremely low pitched sound to communicate This infrasound as a means of communication has special merit It can travel a greater distance than higher pitched noise Such long distance communication is a must for animals such as giraffes or elephants that roam over wide areas Some animals communicate with each other using infrasound that travels farther than higher pitched sounds Some people have defined wildlife damage management as the science and management of overabundant species but this definition is too narrow All wildlife species act in ways that harm human interests Thus all species cause wildlife damage not just overabundant ones One interesting example of this involves endangered peregrine falcons in California which prey on another endangered species the California least tern Certainly we would not consider peregrine falcons as being overabundant but we wish that they would not feed on an endangered species In this case one of the negative values associated with a peregrine falcon population is that its predation reduces the population of another endangered species The goal of wildlife damage management in this case would be to stop the falcons from eating the terns without harming the falcons Through recent decades academic archaeologists have been urged to conduct their research and excavations according to hypothesis testing procedures It has been argued that we should construct our general theories deduce testable propositions and prove or disprove them against the sampled data In fact the application of this scientific method often ran into difficulties The data have a tendency to lead to unexpected questions problems and issues Thus archaeologists claiming to follow hypothesis testing procedures found themselves having to create a fiction In practice their work and theoretical conclusions partly developed from the data which they had discovered In other words they already knew the data when they decided upon an interpretation But in presenting their work they rewrote the script placing the theory first and claiming to have tested it against data which they discovered as in an experiment under laboratory conditions Digital technology accelerates dematerialization by hastening the migration from products to services The liquid nature of services means they don t have to be bound to materials But dematerialization is not just about digital goods The reason even solid physical goods like a soda can can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits The tangible is replaced by intangibles intangibles like better design innovative processes smart chips and eventually online connectivity that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do Soft things like intelligence are thus embedded into hard things like aluminum that make hard things behave more like software Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if they were intangible services Nouns morph to verbs Hardware behaves like software In Silicon Valley they say it like this Software eats everything Not all Golden Rules are alike two kinds emerged over time The negative version instructs restraint the positive encourages intervention One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior While examples of these rules abound too many to list exhaustively let these versions suffice for our purpose here What is hateful to you do not do to another and Love another as yourself Both versions insist on caring for others whether through acts of omission such as not injuring or through acts of commission by actively intervening Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other they do not require abandoning self concern altogether The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self referential Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in made the term sustainability widely known around the world the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as pro environmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior It became a public relations term an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm But then in a decade or so some governments industries educational institutions and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing green products but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions While the term sustainability in the initial phase was popular among those who pretended to be eco conscious it later came to be used by those who would actualize their pro environmental thoughts Although prices in most retail outlets are set by the retailer this does not mean that these prices do not adjust to market forces over time On any particular day we find that all products have a specific price ticket on them However this price may be different from day to day or week to week The price that the farmer gets from the wholesaler is much more flexible from day to day than the price that the retailer charges consumers If for example bad weather leads to a poor potato crop then the price that supermarkets have to pay to their wholesalers for potatoes will go up and this will be reflected in the prices they mark on potatoes in their stores Thus these prices do reflect the interaction of demand and supply in the wider marketplace for potatoes Although they do not change in the supermarket from hour to hour to reflect local variations in demand and supply they do change over time to reflect the underlying conditions of the overall production of and demand for the goods in question An individual characteristic that moderates the relationship with behavior is self efficacy or a judgment of one s capability to accomplish a certain level of performance People who have a high sense of self efficacy tend to pursue challenging goals that may be outside the reach of the average person People with a strong sense of self efficacy therefore may be more willing to step outside the culturally prescribed behaviors to attempt tasks or goals for which success is viewed as improbable by the majority of social actors in a setting For these individuals culture will have little or no impact on behavior For example Australians tend to endorse the Tall Poppy Syndrome This saying suggests that any poppy that outgrows the others in a field will get cut down in other words any overachiever will eventually fail Interviews and observations suggest that it is the high self efficacy Australians who step outside this culturally prescribed behavior to actually achieve beyond average Theorists of the novel commonly define the genre as a biographical form that came to prominence in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to establish the individual character as a replacement for traditional sources of cultural authority The novel Georg Luk cs argues seeks by giving form to uncover and construct the concealed totality of life in the interiorized life story of its heroes The typical plot of the novel is the protagonist s quest for authority within therefore when that authority can no longer be discovered outside By this accounting there are no objective goals in novels only the subjective goal of seeking the law that is necessarily created by the individual The distinctions between crime and heroism therefore or between madness and wisdom become purely subjective ones in a novel judged by the quality or complexity of the individual s consciousness Rules can be thought of as formal types of game cues They tell us the structure of the test that is what should be accomplished and how we should accomplish it In this sense rules create a problem that is artificial yet intelligible Only within the rules of the game of say basketball or baseball do the activities of jump shooting and fielding ground balls make sense and take on value It is precisely the artificiality created by the rules the distinctive problem to be solved that gives sport its special meaning That is why getting a basketball through a hoop while not using a ladder or pitching a baseball across home plate while standing a certain distance away becomes an important human project It appears that respecting the rules not only preserves sport but also makes room for the creation of excellence and the emergence of meaning Engaging in acts that would be considered inconsequential in ordinary life also liberates us a bit making it possible to explore our capabilities in a protected environment In some subject areas topics build on one another in a hierarchical fashion so that a learner must almost certainly master one topic before moving to the next For example an elementary school student should probably master principles of addition before moving to multiplication because multiplication is an extension of addition Similarly a medical student must have expertise in human anatomy before studying surgical techniques It s difficult to perform an appendectomy if you can t find the appendix Vertical transfer refers to such situations A learner acquires new knowledge or skills by building on more basic information and procedures In other cases knowledge of one topic may affect learning a second topic even though the first isn t a necessary condition for the second Knowledge of French isn t essential for learning Spanish yet knowing French can help with Spanish because many words are similar in the two languages When knowledge of the first topic is helpful but not essential to learning the second one lateral transfer is occurring In vertical transfer lower level knowledge is essential before one proceeds to a higher level however in the case of lateral transfer prior knowledge can be helpful but it is not required Interest in extremely long periods of time sets geology and astronomy apart from other sciences Geologists think in terms of billions of years for the age of Earth and its oldest rocks numbers that like the national debt are not easily comprehended Nevertheless the time scales of geological activity are important for environmental geologists because they provide a way to measure human impacts on the natural world For example we would like to know the rate of natural soil formation from solid rock to determine whether topsoil erosion from agriculture is too great Likewise understanding how climate has changed over millions of years is vital to properly assess current global warming trends Clues to past environmental change are well preserved in many different kinds of rocks Politics cannot be suppressed whichever policy process is employed and however sensitive and respectful of differences it might be In other words there is no end to politics It is wrong to think that proper institutions knowledge methods of consultation or participatory mechanisms can make disagreement go away Theories of all sorts promote the view that there are ways by which disagreement can be processed or managed so as to make it disappear The assumption behind those theories is that disagreement is wrong and consensus is the desirable state of things In fact consensus rarely comes without some forms of subtle coercion and the absence of fear in expressing a disagreement is a source of genuine freedom Debates cause disagreements to evolve often for the better but a positively evolving debate does not have to equal a reduction in disagreement The suppression of disagreement should never be made into a goal in political deliberation A defense is required against any suggestion that political disagreement is not the normal state of things To make plans for the future the brain must have an ability to take certain elements of prior experiences and reconfigure them in a way that does not copy any actual past experience or present reality exactly To accomplish that the organism must go beyond the mere ability to form internal representations the models of the world outside It must acquire the ability to manipulate and transform these models We can argue that tool making one of the fundamental distinguishing features of primate cognition depends on this ability since a tool does not exist in a ready made form in the natural environment and has to be imagined in order to be made The neural machinery for creating and holding images of the future was a necessary prerequisite for tool making and thus for launching human civilization Since life began in the oceans most life including freshwater life has a chemical composition more like the ocean than fresh water It appears that most freshwater life did not originate in fresh water but is secondarily adapted having passed from ocean to land and then back again to fresh water As improbable as this may seem the bodily fluids of aquatic animals show a strong similarity to oceans and indeed most studies of ion balance in freshwater physiology document the complex regulatory mechanisms by which fish amphibians and invertebrates attempt to maintain an inner ocean in spite of surrounding fresh water It is these sorts of unexpected complexities and apparent contradictions that make ecology so interesting The idea of a fish in a freshwater lake struggling to accumulate salts inside its body to mimic the ocean reminds one of the other great contradiction of the biosphere plants are bathed in an atmosphere composed of roughly three quarters nitrogen yet their growth is frequently restricted by lack of nitrogen When considered in terms of evolutionary success many of the seemingly irrational choices that people make do not seem so foolish after all Most animals including our ancestors and modern day capuchin monkeys lived very close to the margin of survival Paleontologists who study early human civilizations have uncovered evidence that our ancestors faced frequent periods of drought and freezing When you are living on the verge of starvation a slight downturn in your food reserves makes a lot more difference than a slight upturn Anthropologists who study people still living in hunter gatherer societies have discovered that they regularly make choices designed to produce not the best opportunity for obtaining a hyperabundant supply of food but instead the least danger of ending up with an insufficient supply In other words people everywhere have a strong motivation to avoid falling below the level that will feed themselves and their families If our ancestors hadn t agonized over losses and instead had taken too many chances in going after the big gains they d have been more likely to lose out and never become anyone s ancestor Our ancestors gave priority to securing minimum resources rather than pursuing maximum gains and that was the rational choice for human survival from an evolutionary perspective According to many sociologists the study of what our society calls art can only really progress if we drop the highly specific and ideologically loaded terminology of art artworks and artists and replace these with the more neutral and less historically specific terms cultural forms cultural products and cultural producers These cultural products be they paintings sculptures forms of music or whatever should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts By using the more neutral term cultural products for particular objects and cultural producers for the people who make those objects the sociologist seeks to break with a view that she he sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category art This is a category that is too limited and context specific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as art and others as not the very term art itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur Quite simply then in order to study cultural matters many sociologists believe one has to reject the terms art artwork and artist as the basis for our analysis Instead these terms become important objects of analysis themselves If an animal is innately programmed for some type of behaviour then there are likely to be biological clues It is no accident that fish have bodies which are streamlined and smooth with fins and a powerful tail Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the water Similarly if you found a dead bird or mosquito you could guess by looking at its wings that flying was its normal mode of transport However we must not be over optimistic Biological clues are not essential The extent to which they are finding varies from animal to animal and from activity to activity For example it is impossible to guess from their bodies that birds make nests and sometimes animals behave in a way quite contrary to what might be expected from their physical form ghost spiders have tremendously long legs yet they weave webs out of very short threads To a human observer their legs seem a great hindrance as they spin and move about the web In researchers at Wayne State University asked a group of college volunteers to exercise for twenty minutes at a self selected pace on each of three machines a treadmill a stationary bike and a stair climber Measurements of heart rate oxygen consumption and perceived effort were taken throughout all three workouts The researchers expected to find that the subjects unconsciously targeted the same relative physiological intensity in each activity Perhaps they would automatically exercise at percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using Or maybe they would instinctively settle into rhythm at percent of their maximum rate of oxygen consumption in all three workouts But that s not what happened There was in fact no consistency in measurements of heart rate and oxygen consumption across the three disciplines Instead the subjects were found to have chosen the same level of perceived effort on the treadmill the bike and the stair climber In the summer of the actor Anthony Hopkins was signed to play a leading role in a film based on George Feifer s novel The Girl from Petrovka That is why he traveled to London to buy a copy of the book Unfortunately none of the main London bookstores had a copy Then on his way home waiting for an underground train at Leicester Square tube station he saw a discarded book lying on the seat next to him It was a copy of The Girl from Petrovka As if that was not coincidence enough more was to follow Later when he had a chance to meet the author Hopkins told him about this strange occurrence Feifer was interested He said to him that in November he had lent a friend a copy of the book a unique copy in which he had made notes on turning the British English into American English for the publication of an American version but his friend had lost the copy in London A quick check of the copy Hopkins had found showed that it was the very same copy that his friend had mislaid Once a hand or gripper has been directed to an object by reaching it can be grasped Grasping requires that fingers hold an object securely A secure grip is one in which the object won t slip or move especially when displaced by an external force Your grasp on a hammer for example would not be secure if knocking against something caused you to drop it One precondition of a firm grasp is that the forces applied by the fingers balance each other so as not to disturb the object s position The characteristics of an object such as its geometric configuration and mass distribution may demand that some fingers apply greater force than others to maintain stability The grasp and support forces must also match overall object mass and fragility An egg requires a more delicate touch than a rock What story could be harsher than that of the Great Auk the large black and white seabird that in northern oceans took the ecological place of a penguin Its tale rises and falls like a Greek tragedy with island populations savagely destroyed by humans until almost all were gone Then the very last colony found safety on a special island one protected from the destruction of humankind by vicious and unpredictable ocean currents These waters presented no problem to perfectly adapted seagoing birds but they prevented humans from making any kind of safe landing After enjoying a few years of comparative safety disaster of a different kind struck the Great Auk Volcanic activity caused the island refuge to sink completely beneath the waves and surviving individuals were forced to find shelter elsewhere The new island home they chose lacked the benefits of the old in one terrible way Humans could access it with comparative ease and they did Within just a few years the last of this once plentiful species was entirely eliminated It is not hard to see that a strong economy where opportunities are plentiful and jobs go begging helps break down social barriers Biased employers may still dislike hiring members of one group or another but when nobody else is available discrimination most often gives way to the basic need to get the work done The same goes for employees with prejudices about whom they do and do not like working alongside In the American construction boom of the late s for example even the carpenters union long known as a traditional bastion of white men a world where a coveted union card was handed down from father to son began openly encouraging women blacks and Hispanics to join its internship program At least in the workplace jobs chasing people obviously does more to promote a fluid society than people chasing jobs One remarkable aspect of aboriginal culture is the concept of totemism where the tribal member at birth assumes the soul and identity of a part of nature This view of the earth and its riches as an intrinsic part of oneself clearly rules out mistreatment of the environment because this would only constitute a destruction of self Totems are more than objects They include spiritual rituals oral histories and the organization of ceremonial lodges where records of the past travel routes of the soul can be exchanged with others and converted to mythology The primary motivation is the preservation of tribal myths and a consolidation and sharing of every individual s origins in nature The aborigines see their relationship to the environment as a single harmonious continuum through a hierarchy of totems that connect to their ancestral origins a cosmology that places them at one with the earth and behavior patterns that respect ecological balance Lawyers and scientists use argument to mean a summary of evidence and principles leading to a conclusion however a scientific argument is different from a legal argument A prosecuting attorney constructs an argument to persuade the judge or a jury that the accused is guilty a defense attorney in the same trial constructs an argument to persuade the same judge or jury toward the opposite conclusion Neither prosecutor nor defender is obliged to consider anything that weakens their respective cases On the contrary scientists construct arguments because they want to test their own ideas and give an accurate explanation of some aspect of nature Scientists can include any evidence or hypothesis that supports their claim but they must observe one fundamental rule of professional science They must include all of the known evidence and all of the hypotheses previously proposed Unlike lawyers scientists must explicitly account for the possibility that they might be wrong Unlike lawyers who utilize information selectively to support their arguments scientists must include all information even if some of it is unlikely to strengthen their arguments The idea of protecting intellectual activity and creation has deep roots The ancient Greeks used an awards system to recognize design achievements which performed some of the same functions as the modern patent system Their pottery sculptures and other manufactured goods had symbols on them to note the tradesmen who created them which are the predecessors of modern trademarks Similar marks and symbols functioning as trademarks have been found on Chinese pottery possibly dating as far back as BCE and in many other ancient societies including the Egyptians the Assyrians and the Vedic civilization The concept of intellectual property continued to develop during the Roman period The Roman Empire had an incredible variety of trademarks Roman potters alone used approximately trademarks Additionally Roman authors had a sense that their intellectual creations were outdated as they complained about the exploitation of those creations Their sense of injustice was probably heightened by the fact that there were laws and traditions in place that supported their belief that only they could exploit their creations Roman authors could in fact make money from the copying and publishing of their works because the value of their intellectual creations was recognized In an increasingly globalized world literature in translation has an especially important role Increasingly writers readers and publishers are turning to literature as a bridge between cultures particularly Western and Arab societies This growing interest is in turn driving a boom in translation However not surprisingly perhaps most translations are from English into other languages not from another language such as Arabic into English Hence the huge American market is seen as driving the imbalance Bookstores in the United States for example rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz s Cairo Trilogy a masterful realistic account of life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid th century Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz s more experimental work his political and religious allegories or his historical dramas The result is a kind of one way mirror between America and the rest of the world We tend to assume that the way to get more time is to speed up But speeding up can actually slow us down Anyone who has ever rushed out of the house only to realize that their keys and wallet are sitting on the kitchen table knows this only too well And it s not just our efficiency that is reduced The quality of the experience suffers too as we become less aware or mindful Have you ever eaten an entire meal without tasting any of it Hurrying up doesn t just give us less time it can also steal the pleasure and benefit from the time that we do have For many of us hurrying is a way of life Some of us enjoy the thrill that it gives us while others are driven crazy by the constant pressure and feel that their lives are speeding up to an unacceptable degree Either way there are almost certainly areas of our life that could be enhanced by a little go slow behavior The audience receives a sound signal entirely through the vibrations generated in the air whereas in a singer some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear through the singer s own bones Since these two ways of transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies at various frequencies the overall quality of the sound will be quite different You have probably experienced this when you have listened to your own voice as on tape or through a public address system It is easy to blame the sound of a stranger on poor electronics but this is only partly justified The major effect comes from the fact that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear you This is one of the main reasons why even the most accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of coaches and voice teachers as to how they sound whereas no concert violinist would have to do such a thing To the violinist playing sounds almost exactly the same as it does to someone else standing nearby Problems can be distinguished according to whether they are reasonable or unreasonable Reasonable problems are of the kind that can be solved in a step by step manner A crossword puzzle is of this nature Given a sufficient vocabulary the empty spaces can be filled in one by one Unreasonable problems in contrast cannot be treated this way because the task contains some trick or catch that must be understood before someone can arrive at a solution This feature frustrates any step by step process that proceeds without the realization that things aren t what they seem Hence successful problem solving in these cases requires that the person acquire an insight into the nature of the trick Riddles provide commonplace instances of such insight problems such as the classic riddle that the Sphinx posed to Oedipus There are two types of managers in business organizations functional managers and project managers Both types of managers have different roles and qualities Functional managers head one of a firm s departments such as marketing or engineering and they are specialists in the area they manage They are skilled at breaking the components of a system into smaller elements knowing something of the details of each operation for which they are responsible On the other hand project managers begin their career as specialists in some field When promoted to the position of project manager they must transform from technical caterpillar to generalist butterfly They oversee many functional areas each with its own specialists Therefore what is required is an ability to put many pieces of a task together to form a coherent whole Thus to understand a frog for example functional managers cut it open to examine it but project managers watch it swim with other frogs and consider the environment In business organizations compared with the functional managers who generally analyze what forms a system project managers focus on cimbining all of its elements It isn t going to be easy making changes to the food your children eat and even the most careful patient parents will probably find that the little ones will resist at some point and to some degree The problem is that many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as children we learned the hard way And the temptation to continue with these parental habits with our own children is strong If you were made to sit at the table until you had cleaned your plate you are not alone most of the adult population have suffered this at some point at school if not at home Forcing your children to eat especially if they don t like what is on the plate is completely counterproductive Sit there until you finish may be how we learned and may also be the only way you feel able to achieve your goal but think about it the experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for joy the next time it is served This strict approach is very old fashioned and you may win the battle but you definitely won t win the war Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good idea too but guess what That doesn t work either No pudding until you have finished your main course was the standard line when most parents of today were young and is still commonly used but it only makes sweet things seem more desirable The true champion recognizes that excellence often flows most smoothly from simplicity a fact that can get lost in these high tech days I used to train with a world class runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse meters and pace keepers He spent hours collecting data that he thought would help him improve In fact a good percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other than working out Sports became so complex for him that he forgot how to enjoy himself Contrast his approach with that of the late Abebe Bikila the Ethiopian who won the Olympic Marathon running barefoot High tech clothing and digital watches were not part of his world Abebe Bikila simply ran Many times in running and in other areas of life less is more The origins of contemporary Western thought can be traced back to the golden age of ancient Greece when Greek thinkers laid the foundations for modern Western politics philosophy science and law Their novel approach was to pursue rational inquiry through adversarial discussion The best way to evaluate one set of ideas they decided was by testing it against another set of ideas In the political sphere the result was democracy in which supporters of rival policies vied for rhetorical supremacy in philosophy it led to reasoned arguments and dialogues about the nature of the world in science it prompted the construction of competing theories to try to explain natural phenomena in the field of law the result was the adversarial legal system This approach is the foundation for the modern Western way of life in which politics commerce science and law are all rooted in orderly competition I would like to compare the shift from analog to digital film making to the shift from fresco and tempera to oil painting in the early Renaissance A painter making a fresco has limited time before the paint dries and once it has dried no further changes to the image are possible Similarly a traditional filmmaker has limited means of modifying images once they are recorded on film Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the practice of special effects during the analog period of cinema A painter working with tempera could modify and rework the image but the process was painstaking and slow The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions as well as to modify them as long as necessary Similarly by allowing a filmmaker to treat a film image as an oil painting digital technology redefines what can be done with cinema When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message and the nonverbal message the latter typically weighs more in forming a judgment For example a friend might react to a plan for dinner with a comment like that s good but with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression In spite of the verbal comment the lack of expressive enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn t viewed very positively In such a case the purpose of the positive comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the friend but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally leaks a more candid negative reaction to the plan Of course the muted expressive display might also be strategic and intentional That is the nonverbal message is deliberate but designed to let the partner know one s candid reaction indirectly It is then the partner s responsibility to interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment in the plan An ant turns right left and moves ahead over a sandy hill How can we explain the complexity of the path it chose We can think up a sophisticated program in the ant s brain but it does not work What we have overlooked is the ant s environment The ant may be following a simple rule get out of the sun and back to the nest Complex behavior does not imply complex mental strategies The same holds for humans The apparent complexity of a man s behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself People adapt to their environments much as gelatin does if you wish to know what form it will have when it solidifies study the shape of the mold that holds the gelatin To understand behavior one has to look at both the mind and the environment Although we tend to associate complex behavior with complex mental operations environmental factors need to be considered as well for a better understanding of such behavior When someone asks us How does that work or Why does that happen we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer After all it is efficient Another person asks a question we provide the answer to the question It is usually a win win The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence the loss of confidence Although the question wanted for an explanation what the asker received was a statement of fact Why does oil float on top of water in a glass Relative density What causes climate change Increased CO in the atmosphere Why does the ocean have tides The moon Giving direct accurate and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer But in reality it can shut the asker down A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step If the asker isn t familiar with relative density or CO he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a follow up question or probe for related ideas Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity Although direct answers are often needed and well placed they do not work universally A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of efficiency B B Appearance creates the first impression customers have of food and first impressions are important No matter how appealing the taste an unattractive appearance is hard to overlook As humans we do eat with our eyes because our sense of sight is more highly developed than the other senses The sense of sight is so highly developed in humans that messages received from other senses are often ignored if they conflict with what is seen Yellow candy is expected to be lemon flavored and if it is grape flavored many people cannot correctly identify the flavor Strawberry ice cream tinted with red food coloring seems to have a stronger strawberry flavor than one that has no added food coloring even when there is no real difference B The Rust Belt is notorious for its poor air quality For decades coal plants steel production and auto emissions have pumped particulates like sulfate into the atmosphere over the eastern U S Especially before air quality laws began appearing in the s particulate pollution was behind acid rain respiratory disease and ozone depletion But a new study from Harvard University suggests that the Rust Belt s thick particulate fog may have helped slow down the effects of climate change particularly when it was thickest Throughout the th century global temperatures have gone up by just under one degree Celsius But in the U S eastern and central states haven t seen the same rise In fact temperatures there actually decreased over the same period The reason seems to be particulate pollution Instead of trapping warm air in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide fine particles like sulfate reflect the sun s light and heat They may even group with watery cloud droplets which do the same thing The effect is a net cooling across entire regions B Suppose a survivor from an airplane crash with severe injuries struggles for days through the jungle but dies just before reaching a village It is tempting to think if only he had managed to walk to the village he would have been rescued But suppose you must try to console the victim s relatives What might you say Or suppose you wish to defend the rescue team who got as far as the village but no further Your motivation to console or defend may influence the alternative you imagine You may decide to emphasize the severity of the victim s injuries and suggest even if he had managed to walk to the village he still would have died Sometimes thoughts about what might have been change an antecedent event the victim walked to the village but leave the outcome unchanged he still died Even if conditionals have been called semifactual because they combine a counterfactual antecedent and a factual consequence Imagined semifactual alternatives are intriguing because unlike other thoughts about what might have been they suggest that the outcome is inevitable B The so called Mozart effect listening to Mozart will make your child smarter is a good example of a scientific finding being distorted by the media through hype not warranted by the research It all started when researchers reported that after exposure to a selection of Mozart s music college students showed an increase in spatial reasoning for about minutes on tasks like putting together pieces of a jigsaw puzzle Note first that the research was done on college students not infants and that the effect was very brief In addition no one s been able to replicate the research The increase in spatial reasoning it turns out can be generated by any auditory stimulation e g listening to a short story or other types of music that keeps people alert while being tested However none of this has stopped eager parents spurred on by fantastic claims from unethical companies from purchasing Mozart CDs for their babies B As the structures of our world and the conditions of certainty have yielded to an avalanche of change the extent of our longing for stable definitive leadership has been exceeded only by the impossibility of finding it The fault lies not with leadership but rather with ourselves and our expectations In the old days leaders were supposed to make sense of chaos to make certainty out of doubt and to create positive action plans for the resolution of paradoxes Good leaders straightened things out Should chaos rear its ugly head the leader was expected to restore normality immediately But chaos is now considered normal paradoxes cannot be resolved and certainty is possible only to the level of high probability Leadership that attempts to deliver in terms of fixing any of these can only fail And that is exactly what is happening B When a company comes out with a new product its competitors typically go on the defensive doing whatever they can to reduce the odds that the offering will eat into their sales Responses might include increasing marketing efforts offering discounts to channel partners and even lobbying for regulations that would hinder the rival s expansion In many cases though such actions are misguided Although the conventional wisdom that a rival s launch will hurt profits is often correct my research shows that companies sometimes see profits increase after a rival s launch The underlying mechanism is pretty simple When a company comes out with a new product it often raises the prices of its existing products This might be designed to make the new product look cheaper and thus more attractive by comparison As that company adjusts its pricing its competitors can do the same without risking customer defections over price B All human societies have economic systems within which goods and services are produced distributed and consumed In one sense the economic aspect of culture is simply the sum of the choices people make regarding these areas of their lives These choices critically determine much of people s lives For example choosing to become a farmer rather than an insurance broker may determine where you live who you are likely to meet the sorts of behaviors you will expect in your spouse and offspring and so on However such choices are not unlimited rather they are limited by our cultures traditions and technologies Furthermore our environments set the boundaries within which choices about the production distribution and consumption of goods and services are made To the extent that economic systems are part of culture people in different cultures have different sorts of economic behavior B A narrative is not a myth the first time it is told but only a story or an account What makes a story a myth is the fact that it is received by a given society and that a given society participates in its transmission Obviously it is difficult to determine just when any story becomes a myth but it is clear that a narrative is not a myth when it is first told The intentions of the first narrator and the last narrator can be the same but this still does not give any special status to the creator of a myth It is far more important to realize that the intentions of a given society in transmitting a narrative may have nothing to do with the purposes of its author Thus we can never identify any individual creator of a myth So long as myth is a collective narrative by definition the only relevant consideration are the mentality and purposes of the society for which the myth is a myth Given the collective nature of a myth a narrative becomes a myth only when a given society accepts and transmits it regardless of the intentions of its author B Carrying capacity is the number of individuals that the local resources can sustain Individuals in a population that has exceeded the carrying capacity of its habitat may have poor health and suffer from malnutrition because of the compromised living conditions When this happens the weakest individuals may die or the population as a whole may become more vulnerable to further environmental stress or disease Sometimes a large number of individuals in a population die as a result of overshooting the carrying capacity of their habitat This is known as a die off Certain animals and plants have a built in sense of carrying capacity so that instead of overshooting and having a die off they remain within the limits of their habitat s ability to support them Lake trout for instance stop breeding as prolifically when the population density increases too dramatically Although this is the result of individual responses to chemical signals from other trout rather than a thought out response on the part of the trout the result is that population numbers may remain steady for extended periods The trout will produce more offspring and mature to a reproductive size at a faster rate when populations are threatened such as when aggressive fishing takes place When space and food are scarce such as when a lot of fish are living together in a small pond the trout remain smaller and reproduce more slowly Experiments have shown that no matter what number of lake trout a pond is stocked with in the beginning the population will increase until it reaches a particular density then level off at about the same number A A It is known that people are extremely limited in the amount of information that they can process at any given time A common metaphor in early theories of attention is the concept of a bottleneck This metaphor is especially appealing because it matches our understanding about attention The narrow neck of a bottle restricts the flow into or out of the bottle This kind of flow in the narrow passageway is similar to the way people process information In other words this bottleneck limits the quantity of information to which we can pay attention Thus when one message is currently flowing through a bottleneck the other messages must be left behind A Many people have pointed out that personal responsibility can often be lost in groups Consider how often you ve passed someone who is pulled over on the side of the road with car trouble It is easy to justify your failure to help by telling yourself someone else will stop Corporations add another layer of complication to the story of reduced personal responsibility in group settings because corporations are set up to assign legal responsibility to the corporation itself instead of to its members There are other complex organizations in which the individual members are often not sure of their impact or power to bring about change In this kind of culture someone else will do it is a common excuse A Appearance creates the first impression customers have of food and first impressions are important No matter how appealing the taste an unattractive appearance is hard to overlook As humans we do eat with our eyes because our sense of sight is more highly developed than the other senses The sense of sight is so highly developed in humans that messages received from other senses are often ignored if they conflict with what is seen Yellow candy is expected to be lemon flavored and if it is grape flavored many people cannot correctly identify the flavor Strawberry ice cream tinted with red food coloring seems to have a stronger strawberry flavor than one that has no added food coloring even when there is no real difference A When plants were first grouped together it was merely for convenience Even today plants may be categorized together in unnatural groupings in order to make them easier to identify For example some wildflower books arrange together all white flowered species or all yellow flowered species However such groupings do not reflect natural relationships and make it difficult to recognize family characteristics We don t infer that all persons with red hair are more closely related to each other than they are to those with dark hair likewise all long haired dogs are not more closely related to each other than they are to short haired dogs Modern botanists therefore try to group plants according to their natural relationships A Because the Internet is free space where anybody can post anything it can be full of all sorts of useless data As a result organized knowledge could easily get corrupted or lost in a sea of junk data For books there are various filters that help readers distinguish between reliable and unreliable information On the Internet the relation between the producer and the consumer of information tends to be direct so nothing protects the consumer from polluted information There are of course advantages to the free exchange of information and I do believe any producers of data should have the freedom to make them available online However I am also convinced that users should be protected from corrupt knowledge by intermediary services There need to be some forms of guides and filters provided by responsible individuals and organizations Otherwise we may no longer be able to distinguish between the intellectual space of information and a polluted environment of meaningless data Thus reliable intermediary services will be needed in the future The sun is slowly getting brighter as its core contracts and heats up In a billion years it will be about percent brighter than today heating the planet to an uncomfortable degree Water evaporating from the oceans may set off a runaway greenhouse effect that turns Earth into a damp version of Venus wrapped permanently in a thick white blanket of cloud Or the transformation may take some time and be more gentle with an increasingly hot and cloudy atmosphere able to shelter microbial life for some time Either way water will escape into the stratosphere and be broken down by UV light into oxygen and hydrogen Oxygen will be left in the stratosphere perhaps misleading aliens into thinking the planet is still inhabited while the hydrogen is light enough to escape into space So our water will gradually leak away Imagine a child playing on the beach below a cliff He finds a cave and full of excitement goes in Suddenly fear seizes him In the deep dark of the cave he cannot see the way ahead What is frightening him is the sense of the unknown stretching into the black distance Worries can be like this Our anxiety is not about something specific but more of a sense that unknown and uncertain possibilities may be out of sight far ahead We can stop these worries from growing A powerful torch or flashlight could have shown the child the limits of the cave We can place limits on our worries by asking What is the worst that can happen More often than not the worst that we fear is much less terrible than our vague unarticulated fear Once we know the worst we can face it directly and work out more sensibly what to do People have found many ways to reduce stress or control their responses to it Possibilities include special breathing routines exercise meditation and distraction as well as trying to deal with the problem that caused the stress Social support is one of the most powerful methods of coping with stress and researchers have demonstrated its effectiveness by brain measurements as well as people s self reports In one study happily married women were given moderately painful shocks to their ankles On various trials they held the hand of their husband a man they did not know or no one Holding the husband s hand reduced the response in several brain areas Holding the hand of an unknown man reduced the response a little on the average but not as much as holding the husband s hand In short as expected brain responses correspond to people s self reports that social support from a loved one helps reduce stress Lifeline infrastructures are vital systems that support a nation s economy and quality of life Modern economies rely on the ability to move goods people and information safely and reliably Adding to their importance is that many of the lifeline systems serve vital roles in disaster recovery Consequently it is of the utmost importance to government business and the public at large that the flow of services provided by a nation s infrastructure continues unimpeded in the face of a broad range of natural and technological hazards The linkage between systems and services is critical to any discussion of infrastructure Although it is the performance of the hardware i e the highways pipes and transmission lines that is of immediate concern following an earthquake it is actually the loss of services that these systems provide that is the real loss to the public Therefore a high priority in protecting these systems from hazards is ensuring the continuity or at least the rapid restoration of service Essentially the same structural forms of politics can nevertheless take on very different flavors For example a dictatorship can in theory be brutal or benevolent anarchy can in theory consist of mutual aid or a war of all against all that proceeds in the absence of any rule of law whatsoever democracies can and typically are distinguished in terms of the extent to which they are socially oriented as opposed to individualistically oriented Thus whatever our answer to the What is the best structural form of politics question we still want to know what flavor this structural form of politics ought to have since Indeed political structure by itself does not determine political content this is precisely why we vote within a democratic structure to determine the flavor we want that democratic structure to have The greatest errors in judging a person are made by his parents this is a fact but how is one to explain it Do the parents have too much experience of the child and can they no longer compose it into a unity We notice that travelers in a strange land grasp correctly the common distinctive traits of a people only in the first period of their stay the more they get to know a people the more they forget how to see what is typical and distinctive about it As soon as they see up close they stop being farsighted Might parents judge their children wrongly because they have never stood far enough off from them A quite different explanation would be the following people tend to stop thinking about things that are closest to them and simply accept them When parents are required to judge their children it is perhaps their customary thoughtlessness that makes them judge so mistakenly Persuasion is the strategic use of language to move an audience It works by appealing to our emotion as well as by appealing to our reason Therefore sometimes you may try to appeal to an emotion in your audience by imitating it hysteria by being hysterical anger by raging Also you may try to re create the circumstances which excited in you the emotions that you want to excite in your audience However the best measure is to appear calm detached thoroughly in control of your feelings while you are controlling your narrative for your own purposes Even your choice of words should be selective you must pay attention to their nuances If you address a labor union for example it will make a great difference whether you refer to the members as workers comrades or just people All art is creation regardless of how closely the imitation approximates the original Even the most rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is ultimately selective Doing a portrait for example the artist may ask the subject to look serious not smile selecting a certain aspect of the person We know Mona Lisa Giaconda the subject of the most famous portrait in the world through her mysterious smile but we will never know what the entire person was like The treasure of art however is that its reality lives forever The final product is really an addition to reality not simply a way of totally reproducing it The artist always contributes something new something that never was put together in precisely that way before Leonardo s Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa The latter has long since gone to her reward the former will never die Every work of art no matter how precisely it imitates the original is not a mere reproduction but a unique creation that exists on its own and never perishes All his life Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a police officer But there was a major obstacle standing in his way He had leukemia and was not expected to make it to adulthood When he was seven years old Chris s disease got worse That s when a family friend Tommy Austin arranged for Chris to come as close as he could to living his dream He called Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day with some police officers When the day arrived Chris was welcomed by three squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer Frank Shankwitz Then he was treated to a ride in a police helicopter The officers finished the day by swearing Chris in as the first and only honorary state trooper The next day Cox presented Chris with an official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform With a smile that lit up the room he accepted it Two days later Chris died in the hospital his uniform close at hand Shankwitz was very sad but grateful that he had helped Chris He also realized that there were many other children like Chris That prompted Shankwitz to co found the Make A Wish Foundation It has now become the largest wish granting organization in the world enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand children The wrapping of Christmas presents William Waits notes is a fairly recent phenomenon in American life It arose at the turn of the th century during a period when hand made presents were giving way to machine made store bought ones For both givers and manufacturers this shift presented a problem for the machine made items precisely because they were convenient represented less of the giver s personal attention than the hand made items had done thus they were symbolically less intimate To disguise this loss of symbolic value and to invest the manufactured items with a personal touch retailers encouraged shoppers to have their purchases gift wrapped Gift wrapping in Waits s acute term became a decontaminating mechanism that removed the presents from the normal flow of bought and sold goods and made them for a single ceremonial moment emblems of intimacy rather than commerce Some people tend to be late as a general rule whether they are busy or not To stop being late all one has to do is change the motivation by deciding that in all circumstances being on time is going to have first priority over any other consideration Presto You will never have to run for a plane or miss an appointment again As a lifelong latecomer that is how I cured myself Having made the decision that promptness was now of major importance I found that answers came automatically to such questions as Can I squeeze in one more errand before the dentist or Do I have to leave for the airport now The answers are always no and yes Choosing to be on time will make your life enormously easier and that of your family friends and colleagues as well The hazards of migration range from storms to starvation but they are outweighed by the advantages to be found in the temporary superabundance of food in the summer home The process of evolution ensures that a species migrates only if it pays it to do so Birds of the same species may be migratory in one area but sedentary elsewhere Most song thrushes migrate from northern Scotland but in the south of England the balance of advantage against disadvantage is so delicate that while some migrate to Spain and Portugal the majority normally stay in England over winter Moreover England s winters have been getting warmer since the late s and if the trend continues it is likely that our song thrushes will become increasingly sedentary Some people believe that giving to charity is some kind of instinct developed because it benefits our species in some way At first this seems like a strange idea Darwin s theories of evolution presume that individuals should act to preserve their own interests not those of the species as a whole But the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins believes that natural selection has given us the ability to feel pity for someone who is suffering When humans lived in small clan based groups a person in need would be a relative or someone who could pay you back a good turn later so taking pity on others could benefit you in the long run Modern societies are much less close knit and when we see a heartfelt appeal for charity chances are we may never even meet the person who is suffering but the emotion of pity is still in our genes Essentially your reputation is your most valuable asset so guard it well But do not be terribly demoralized if you make some mistakes along the way With time it is possible to repair a stained reputation Every experience you have with someone else is like a drop of water falling into a pool As your experiences with that person grow the drops accumulate and the pool deepens Positive interactions are clear drops of water and negative interactions are red drops of water But they are not equal That is a number of clear drops can dilute one red drop and that number differs for different people Those who are very forgiving only need a few positive experiences clear drops to dilute a bad experience while those who are less forgiving need a lot more to wash away the red When you are picking out products in the grocery store searching for the best possible strawberry jam you are trying to maximize your own enjoyment You are the only person that matters it is your sense of pleasure that you are trying to please In this case selfishness is the ideal strategy You should listen to those cells in the brain that tell you what you really want However when you are making a moral decision this egocentric strategy backfires Moral decisions require taking other people into account You cannot act like a greedy brute or let your anger get out of control Doing the right thing means thinking about everybody else using the emotional brain to mirror the emotions of strangers Selfishness needs to be balanced by some selflessness We tend to consider ourselves as rational decision makers logically evaluating the costs and benefits of each alternative we encounter However we are much more primitive than most assume A team of economists looked at how consumers reacted to various pitches by banks to take out a loan A purely rational view would have predicted that interest rates would be the only factor that had an impact But the scientists varied more than just the interest rate they also tested how persuasive other approaches might be For instance some letters offered a chance to win a cell phone in a lottery if the customer came in to inquire about a loan They found that such an offer increased loan inquiries by as much as dropping the interest rate five points For a loan this meant some customers were in essence willing to pay more in interest to receive a cell phone Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors comes from studies of the following type Soak your tongue for seconds in a sour solution such as unsweetened lemon juice Then try tasting some other sour solution such as dilute vinegar You will find that the second solution tastes less sour than usual Depending on the concentrations of the lemon juice and vinegar the second solution may not taste sour at all This phenomenon called adaptation reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes Now try tasting something salty sweet or bitter These substances taste about the same as usual In short you experience little cross adaptation reduced response to one taste after exposure to another Evidently the sour receptors are different from the other taste receptors Similarly you can show that salt receptors are different from the others and so forth The fact that the intensity of a taste is decreased after trying the same taste but not after trying a different taste serves as evidence for the existence of distinct receptors for different tastes I observe the moon wherever I go What phase is it in I wonder When will it reach the full moon phase Now imagine what happened to me recently when I was teaching in Australia miles from my hometown in North America Shortly after my arrival seeing that the skies were cloudy I checked the newspaper for a weather report Typically the weather page also gives times for sunrise and sunset as well as moonrise and moonset Picture my surprise when I discovered that the illustrations in the newspaper were by my experience wrong The waxing moon appeared to be illuminated on the left side rather than the right side as I had always known it to be I must call the newspaper I thought But I continued to study the images in the newspaper and then consulted a globe When I imagined myself standing on a spot in the southern hemisphere the answer came to me Here indeed south of the equator the waxing moon appears to be on the left Try this in your imagination and you will see it too The point is that often we do not see things as they are Instead we see things as we are That is why it is necessary in science to have many people making many observations of the same phenomenon I am sure that to people in Australia the moon in North America would seem strange as well The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish When you can do this without having to force people or hurt them when they willingly grant you what you desire then your power is untouchable The best way to achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence The master requires your services he is weak or unable to function without you you have involved yourself in his work so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great difficulty or at least would mean valuable time lost in training another to replace you Once such a relationship is established you have the upper hand to make the master do as you wish It is the classic case of the servant of the king who actually controls the king If you were a butterfly would you be attracted to a more colorful flower or a less colorful one Most of you would probably prefer the more colorful option The same is true for pollinators such as bees and butterflies For years biologists have known that flowers use striking colors scents elaborately shaped petals and nectar to attract pollinators Recent studies however reveal another powerful tool of attraction used by flowers moving in the wind Scientists have discovered that mobile flowers are visited more often by pollinating insects than their more static counterparts It is almost as if the flowers are waving to the insects saying Welcome Come here and have a drink Along with this interesting finding scientists have also concluded that due to their greater range of motion flowers with long thin stalks attract more insects A brilliant friend of mine once told me When you suddenly see a problem something happens that you have the answer before you are able to put it into words It is all done subconsciously This has happened many times to me This feeling of knowing without being able to say how one knows is common The French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal is famous for saying The heart has its reasons that reason cannot know The great nineteenth century mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss also admitted that intuition often led him to ideas he could not immediately prove He said I have had my results for a long time but I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them Fittingly so sometimes true genius simply cannot be put into words Researchers have come to understand how the African village weaverbird prevents itself from being taken advantage of by cuckoos it is all down to the speckles on the eggs David Lahti and his colleagues have described how village weaverbirds lay eggs which all show a very similar pattern of speckles suggesting that if a cuckoo laid an egg in the nest the weaverbird will be able to spot the foreign egg almost immediately But when the researchers studied two colonies of the birds that had been introduced more than years ago to two islands without any cuckoos they found that those birds eggs no longer exhibited the same speckle patterns In a neat demonstration of the power of evolution these results show how in the absence of pressure from parasitic cuckoos the appearance of the eggs has altered because having a similar pattern is no longer so much of an advantage Why don t we think differently more often The reason is that we do not need to be creative for most of what we do For example we do not need to be creative when we are driving on the freeway or riding in an elevator or waiting in line at a grocery store We are creatures of habit when it comes to the business of living For most of our activities these routines are indispensable Without them our lives would be in chaos and we would not get much accomplished If you got up this morning and started contemplating the shape of your toothbrush or questioning the meaning of toast you probably would not make it to work In Chinese food the idea is that it should be boiling hot because that is crucial to its flavor embodied in the phrase wok hei which means the breath or essence of the combination of tastes added by a hot wok In Belgian researchers at Leuven University confirmed just how the link between temperature and taste works They identified microscopic channels in our taste buds which seem to respond differently at different temperatures Apparently the higher the temperature the more intense the flavor This is why ice cream does not taste that sweet straight from the fridge which is why ice cream makers add stacks of sugar as you can tell all too clearly when ice cream melts In a similar way some bitter tastes like tea taste better when hot because they are more intense Unlike the novel short story or play film is not handy to study it cannot be effectively frozen on the printed page The novel and short story are relatively easy to study because they are written to be read The stage play is slightly more difficult to study because it is written to be performed But plays are printed and because they rely heavily on the spoken word imaginative readers can create at least a pale imitation of the experience they might have watching a performance on stage This cannot be said of the screenplay for a film depends greatly on visual and other nonverbal elements that are not easily expressed in writing The screenplay requires so much filling in by our imagination that we cannot really approximate the experience of a film by reading a screenplay and reading a screenplay is worthwhile only if we have already seen the film Thus most screenplays are published not to be read but rather to be remembered If someone were to say Life is a cup of coffee it is unlikely that you would have heard this expression before But its novelty forces you to think about its meaning The vehicle used a cup of coffee is a common object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as a source for thinking about that life The metaphor compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the kinds of physical social and other attributes that are associated with a cup of coffee For this metaphor to gain currency however it must capture the fancy of many other people for a period of time Then and only then will its novelty have become worn out and will it become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor life is a drinking substance After that expressions such as life is a cup of tea life is a bottle of beer life is a glass of milk will become similarly understandable as offering different perspectives on life A new metaphor initially makes people reflect on its meaning if it loses its novelty later by gaining popularity it will give birth to similar types of metaphorical expressions Serafina Vinon a seventy six year old woman from the Italian Alps still gets up at five in the morning to milk her cows Afterward she cooks a huge breakfast cleans the house and depending on the weather and time of year either takes the herd to the meadow tends the orchard or cards some wool In summer she spends weeks on the high pastures cutting hay and then carries huge piles of it on her head the several miles down to the barn She could reach the barn in half the time if she took a direct route but she prefers following invisible winding trails to save the slopes from erosion When Serafina was asked what she enjoys doing most in life she had no trouble answering milking the cows taking them to the pasture tending the orchard carding wool In effect what she enjoys most is what she has been doing for a living all along In her own words It gives me a great satisfaction to be outdoors to talk with people and to be with my animals I talk to everybody plants birds flowers and animals Everything in nature keeps you company you see nature progress every day When she was asked what she would do if she had all the time and money in the world Serafina laughed and repeated the same list of activities It is not that Serafina is ignorant of the alternatives offered by urban life She watches television occasionally and reads newsmagazines But their more fashionable and modern way of life does not attract Serafina she is content with the role she plays in the universe We push down our feelings because most of us have been brought up to believe that there are feelings which are unacceptable Some of us learned that all emotions are unacceptable while others learned that specific emotions such as anger or crying are unacceptable In fact there is absolutely nothing wrong with any kind of feeling When someone tells you not to feel sad or angry he or she is asking the impossible You can deny the feelings you are having but you cannot stop them from coming All that feelings need in order to pass is to be acknowledged and accepted Just saying to yourself or someone else I feel angry or sad or frightened is a great start Let yourself respect the feelings good or bad Human beings direct their activities toward the satisfaction of physical wants and general well being They avoid whenever possible situations that may bring about physical deprivation including pain hunger and a need for sleep Much contemporary advertising promises these satisfactions whether from headache remedies fancy foods or form fitting mattresses An individual can suffer any of these deprivations temporarily however and he may knowingly enter into situations which will deprive him for a time if he believes that there will be mate satisfaction The willingness of astronauts to undergo periods of intense training is at least partially explainable in terms of the great rest that they know will come at the end of their missions No matter how we shake or tap the bottle of ketchup some of it refuses to come out In some cases up to percent of the product is left in the packaging when it is thrown out This is not only annoying for consumers but also poses difficulties when recycling The leftovers first have to be removed from the packaging which is expensive time consuming and uses a great deal of water A German project by the Fraunhofer Institutes together with Munich University of Technology and various industrial partners will put an end to this dilemma Researchers are applying thin films no more than nanometers thick to the inside surface of packaging in order to reduce leftover traces When we have made an error as for example in adding up a column of figures we have a tendency to repeat it again and again This phenomenon is known as the persistent error The same thing happens when we try to solve a problem each time our thoughts take a certain course that course is more likely to be followed the next time The reason that we keep making the same error repeatedly is that associations form between the ideas in the chain of thoughts and become firmer each time they are used until finally the connections are so well established that the chain is very difficult to break Thus once we have adopted an unprofitable line of thought it is harder to adopt a profitable line About three percent of the weight of sea water is accounted for by salt The salt content of the ocean is being continually added to by runoff from the land but it is not increasing Yet salt cannot leave the sea by evaporation because the water vapor leaves it behind So for many years it was a mystery as to why the sea should have so little salt in it given the rate of runoff and particularly if the world was supposed to be hundreds of millions of years old The riddle was not solved until the s when the deep ocean openings were discovered Sea water is swallowed up by these cracks in the ocean bed when it reemerges millions of years later as steam from volcanoes the salt has been filtered out of it on its passage through the rocks Early photography continued the trend toward the imprisonment of the subject and the object of representation During photography s first decades exposure times were quite long For instance the daguerreotype process required exposures of four to seven minutes in the sun and from twelve to sixty minutes indoors Early photographs represented the world as stable eternal and unshakable And when photography ventured to represent living things they had to be immobilized Thus portrait studios universally employed various holding devices to assure the steadiness of the sitter throughout the lengthy time of exposure The devices firmly held the person in place In other words a person who wanted to see his own image became a voluntary prisoner of the machine The introduction of the player piano in the United States at the turn of the th century had been accompanied by fairly critical comments Player pianos produced music mechanically through a set of instructions stored on a music roll Although proponents of the player piano such as piano manufacturers and publishers of sheet music thought that it would lead to an almost universal music education many music teachers musicians and composers opposed it Opponents claimed that one could copy sound but not interpretation and that mechanical instruments reduced the expression of music to mathematical systems For this reason they believed that mechanized music lessened the ideal of beauty by producing the same after same with no soul no joy no passion and that the introduction of the player piano would lead to the disappearance of amateur players While some believed that the player piano would provide a universal music education others criticized its mechanized music from an artistic viewpoint Magicians are honest deceivers To investigate the secret used by magicians to fool their audiences Jastrow worked with two great illusionists He invited these performers to his laboratory and had them participate in a range of tests measuring their speed of movement and accuracy of finger motion But Jastrow s results revealed little out of the ordinary He demonstrated magic has little to do with fast movements Instead magicians use a range of psychological weapons to fool their audiences The technique of suggestion which captures people s minds plays a key role in the process In the same way that people can be made to believe that they once went on a non existent trip in a hot air balloon so magicians have to be able to manipulate people s perception of performance In traditional societies high status may have been extremely hard to acquire but it was also comfortingly hard to lose It was as difficult to stop being a lord as more darkly it was to cease being a servant What mattered was one s identity at birth rather than anything one might achieve in one s lifetime through the exercise of one s abilities The great aspiration of modern societies however has been to reverse this equation to strip away both inherited privilege and inherited under privilege in order to make rank dependent on individual achievement Status in the current society rarely depends on an unchangeable identity handed down through the generations I enjoy shopping at FW Whole Foods nearly as much as I enjoy browsing a good bookstore It s the inspiring expressions that elevate the food into a more exciting experience one with artistic emotional and even political dimensions On a recent visit I filled my shopping cart with eggs from cage free vegetarian hens milk from cows that live free from unnecessary fear and tomatoes from HSR Farm one of the early pioneers of the organic movement In this regard shopping at FW Whole Foods is a literary experience Indeed every time I shop in FW Whole Foods I think that this is a place where the skills of a literary critic might come in handy perhaps also a journalist s Kate and her classmate Jamie were the youngest of the winning teams in the Stop Racism National Video Competition in Their submission depicted children playing at a nursery accompanied by messages such as Everyone is the same all these babies are beautiful Kate says the point of their video was to show that human beings are not genetically coded with racist attitudes Children pick up racist ideas from their surroundings as they grow up she explains And she adds The children at the nursery don t say I am not playing with you since you re black because they don t really know about racism According to Kate education begins with the younger generation And if they grow up experiencing all sorts of cultures they have less bias We re always seeking the next opportunity for something big If you talk to a cab driver in Manhattan you re likely to find that he s going to school to get a better job Likewise if you meet a waitress in Southern California she s likely to tell you that she has an audition for a movie next week The cab driver might never get out of his cab and the waitress might be serving food for the next twenty years but the sense that they re moving toward something more glamorous is very important to them personally On the other hand those who fail to act who accept the limitations of their work without complaining are likely to feel miserable about their lives The hopelessness of their jobs has done critical damage to their identities Charles Wilson was asked how his experience as president of a large company could apply to the presidents of small companies Wilson answered that when he was just a boy he worked for a dairy filling milk bottles The bottles were all different sizes Working in the dairy he learned that no matter what s ize the bottle was the cream the best part of milk always came to the top You can learn the same lesson It doesn t matter what size company you work for you can always be the cream To become the cream continue to learn throughout your life be open to new ideas and be aware of what is going on in the world which will affect you You will rise to the top Inspired by Charles Wilson s experience the author says that regardless of the size of the company anyone can be the best by improving himself herself If you don t have time to walk your child to school every day maybe your child could join a walking bus This is a s et up by which a group of children are walked to school by adult volunteers along a set route Like a normal bus the walking bus follows a timetable so children can be picked up at scheduled times along the way The volunteers take turns supervising the bus This is attractive because the car stays at home which reduces traffic outside the school Also children are getting exercise in the morning and it s said that if children exercise before class their brains are more ready to learn It is better if children can visit their friends in the village by themselves Otherwise you have to walk or drive to drop them off and pick them up wasting valuable time We do have to drive them to activities and classes though For example my daughter Katie has a dance class and my son Peter has football both in neighboring villages What I try to do is to arrange rides for my kids with other parents However I think some people are a bit shy about saying I could take them this week if you could do it next week but I don t mind asking and people are pleased when I do It s not just that it saves fuel time and money but it helps to decrease the amount of traffic in the villages which is also good for the environment Whether you are vacationing in Europe spending the winter in Florida or just visiting a friend s house for the weekend a successful trip depends on good packing Nothing is more frustrating than arriving at your destination only to realize that you have left behind your toothbrush pajamas important medication or travel documents Successful packing requires you to remember everything that you normally need in daily life as well as any special items you will need at your destination Unfortunately most of us pack at the last minute and this kind of stress can interfere with our memories increasing the chances of our forgetting something we might need The distinctive property of cultural behavior as ethologists use the term is the way it is passed on from one generation to the next Instead of being inherited by the process of Mendelian genetics it is inherited by imitation An animal acquires a behavior pattern by imitating it from another Thus for a species to acquire a culture its members should be able not only to learn and memorize but also to meet other members of its own species sufficiently often Cultural behavior is therefore most likely to be found in species that form social groups How can I learn to be a manager A familiar answer to this question is to say that managers learn from experience But can experience alone be the best way to be a manager Several writers have expressed their doubts on this matter Oscar Wilde noted that experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes And the historian Froude wrote that experience teaches slowly and at the cost of mistakes Experience is an essential way of learning to improve but is an imperfect instrument We also need guidance from a good manager who will help us to learn from mistakes and make better use of them in the future Even a relatively small increase in independence in daily lives can make people much happier and lengthen their lives This was evident when doctors in retirement villages in the United States encouraged residents to decide the details of their daily lives themselves They were no longer simply presented with their meals but could choose from a menu While previously the caretakers watered the plants the elderly took over this responsibility for themselves These small changes worked miracles The senior citizens became ill less frequently and in interviews expressed greater happiness Most striking of all the annual death rate was reduced by half At certain times in history cultures have taken it for granted that a person was not fully human unless he or she learned to master thoughts and feelings In ancient Sparta in Republican Rome and among the British upper classes of the Victorian era For example people were held responsible for keeping control of their emotions Anyone who lost his or her temper too easily was deprived of the right to be accepted as a member of the community In other historical periods such as the one in which we are now living however the ability to control oneself is not always highly respected People who attempt it are often thought to be odd While we re walking or traveling we normally spend less than a second looking at everyday objects that we encounter The days pass by us without our really being aware of them Scientists have discovered that the average time we spend looking at things has been s teadily decreasing during the last years In their s tudy they also discovered that this decrease leads to a lack of interest and enjoyment in life Just try looking at objects for at least five seconds Good opportunities for this exercise come when you re walking or looking out of a car or train window You ll find that five s econds is long enough to help you appreciate things from a new point of view Spending more time observing things around us will allow us to enjoy them from a fresh perspective Person A Can you imagine what the world today would be like if Leonardo da Vinci had become a farmer or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart a banker What would the world be like without art To protect and promote culture governments have a responsibility as representatives of society to support the arts Cultural property is not always in fashion but remains important Who if not the government would house these treasures for future generations Without governmental aid to the arts there would be a great deal of culture lost because of a lack of funding to either promote their creation or protect them for future generations Person B The importance of art is determined by the people who value it not by governments acting as its protectors Culture should not be shaped by governments but grow naturally from a society of people When artists show that they are truly gifted their genius will be recognized and rewarded If not it simply has no value in society It would be absurd to sugges t that the government support great plumbers dentists or bankers So it is also absurd to suggest that governments decide what art is and attempt to preserve items they regard as representative of our lives People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value According to some researchers college students experienced much stronger emotions when asked to imagine losses as opposed to gains in their romantic relationships or in their grade point averages Especially under conditions of risk and uncertainty the threat of potential loss plays a critical role in human decision making In this vein physicians advice to smokers describing the number of years to be gained if they do quit might be somewhat ineffective as compared with advice describing the number of years of life to be lost if they do not quit I was using a microcassette recorder to study for a final examination As I was listening to my own reading of a stack of notes I heard myself reacting to the words It was actually kind of funny This gave me the idea of recording myself when I was angry upset or depressed then listening to it later When I was feeling somewhat miserable and sad I started taping myself The next day when I was feeling alright again I played it back It was a real eye opener It really gave me an opportunity to see myself from a different perspective I learned that self change is difficult without some kind of feedback Young writers visiting the National Library are brought to a special section where the rough drafts of famous authors are kept This practice has quite an impact on those writers who previously thought that the works of geniuses arrived complete in a single stroke of inspiration Here young writers can examine how often a successful author starts with an apparently random series of ideas Later many of these ideas are not included in the final design but they were essential to the process of developing a new concept That is the early drafts are not discarded like mistakes but are viewed as the initial steps in unfolding the idea Stephanie Scott s pit bull Reilly Roo is friendly and affectionate even with strangers There s nothing about her that makes her different from any other dog says Stephanie She and others say that a few irresponsible owners give pit bulls a bad name by raising them to fight They point to a government study which says that laws banning specific dog breeds do not work because any type of dog can be trained to attack Some pit bull lovers argue that other dog breeds are just as if not more dangerous I tell people who come to my house Don t worry about my pit bulls worry about my toy poodle She will bite you says Devi Barry a Michigan resident The Douglas Academy has continued to develop After three years of continuing academic achievements we successfully introduced Chinese Spanish and French into the curriculum along with other new courses to keep the academy vital and to meet better the students needs in this age of globalization We also recruited outside supporters who gave financial and other types of aid to help us carry out these new programs We want students to spend most of their time in the academy since many students do not have quiet places to study ready access to tutors or recreation areas in which to play sports or to take part in other activities The Douglas Academy has developed a practical curriculum for students and hopes to make the academy central to students lives In the th century Londoners of every sort enjoyed the theater except some strict people who thought it wasted time that should have been spent working The audience noblemen merchants craftsmen and idlers all went through the same doors together The richer ones sat in the galleries and everyone else stood in the yard shopkeepers with their families young trainees soldiers seamen apple sellers and laborers of all kinds Gentlewomen always had a man with them to show that they were respectable Even for ordinary women it was not acceptable to go alone unless they were selling something Cold and exhausted I went to a small restaurant just beside the station the only one which opened at night It only had four tables and several benches A woman who was both the waitress and the cook took care of three big pots Flames were dancing under them now blue and then red comforting my body and soul In one pot chicken soup was bubbling and steaming Large pieces of pepper were floating on the surface I had intended to get something hot to drink to warm myself but now I hesitated I could not decide whether I should buy a bowl of chicken soup since I cannot stand strong pepper The woman kindly asked me to taste the chicken soup first and then make the decision Her voice was a little bit rough reminding me of my mother Because of her kindness I ordered one bowl The woman stirred the soup and scooped up lots of meat for me I sat in a corner sipping the soup slowly casually listening to country fellows chatting which was like flowing water Here it was simple Here it was warm I wished the night would have been longer so that I could stay here longer I did not care about the restaurant s smallness I did not care about its lack of cleanliness I just wanted to enjoy its quietness and the warmth I was just afraid of returning to the cruel world full of suffering and struggling In everyday language we talk of my place our home and our neighborhood This is because we think of our home as our own private territory People need a place of their own where they can get away from others and feel a sense of being in charge Even within families we attach ourselves to our own territories For example the kitchen tends to belong to the one who prepares the meals We like to have our own workrooms and our own bedrooms or at least our own side of the bed People personalize their territories to emphasize where one ends and another begins The great fault in John s character was a strong dislike of all kinds of domestic duty This was not from a lack of diligence or perseverance He would carry a shotgun on his shoulder for hours to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons and he was always first to appear at local events The women of the village used to count on him to run their errands and he would never refuse to help a neighbor even in the roughest work As for taking care of his own family and keeping his farm in order however he found these tasks impossible In a word John was ready to attend to anybody s business but his own Thanks to the printing press the display of royal power could now be depicted in printed pictures which were sold cheaply and in large quantities Crowning ceremonies court celebrations and parades for military victories could now all be seen by common people who had never been to the capital The state s power was thus brought closer to the people Even the king himself could now be seen by them as he was represented visibly too The pictures showed people what their ruler looked like Not surprisingly kings ensured that they presented themselves as impressively as possible with all the glory of their dignity and power Whether it is a business to business transaction or a retail sale e commerce shifts the balance of power in favor of the customer This happens because the Web reduces distances Instead of spending hours driving around comparison shopping a Web shopper can quickly gather information about products and sellers almost anywhere Businesses have found that the real distance between producers and consumers has disappeared In this new economic situation the buyer is king If one seller cannot deliver a superior product at a competitive price in real time another seller will The realization that any business can directly reach a final consumer is changing the relationships among producers wholesalers distributors retailers and consumers Many public figures have hired speech writers for political or business purposes You may have heard such well known phrases as Read my lips or A kinder gentler nation A female professional speech writer is credited with creating these phrases capturing abstract ideas and putting them into practical language The very existence of speech writers like her causes many politicians or business people to think that if they just hire a good speech writer they will become memorable speech makers overnight Unfortunately that assumption is wrong In reality speech writers cannot make their clients great or even good speakers Dear Editor I read with interest the proposal to add four floors to the downtown public library building at a cost of million I am extremely concerned however that no plans have been made to improve user access Despite this please be informed that you are very much in my thoughts during this time of difficulty At present there are only a handful of street parking spaces near the library but you would be lucky to find one free I wonder how many policy makers have driven around and around searching for a parking place How many have walked five or six blocks carrying a back breaking load of books It is utterly useless to spend million on a facility that only a few will have access to The picture storybook is an invitation to begin reading It is a primary source of involvement offering a way for the young child to approach a book to visualize a story and to revis it the story The tellers of these tales create stories that can be easily remembered and appeal to young children by means of text and illustrations Thes e mutually supporting elements are often seen as separate aspects each telling the tale in its own way This has given rise to the name twice told tales However for the young child there is no separation of text and pictures which are as interdependent as the lyrics and melody that make up a song Children unlike adults view both as vital to the meaning of the s tory When a child is undecided about whether she likes the illustrations or the text better therefore we can be s ure that a good match has been achieved The bes t picture books thus contain words and pictures which complement each other and are dependent upon each other to the point that one would be ineffective without the other We are trained to control bad feelings such as anger or sorrow in public and to think before we act on them That doesn t necessarily mean we should make this kind of control a habit in our personal lives My advice Unexpressed feelings are harmful If you re not alone simply postpone them for a few moments Then go somewhere private and do whatever the feeling seems to want you to do Cry tremble or shake your fists In short expressing feelings is good for your mental health Your blood should normally contain a certain amount of water and salt This is also true of the tissues Now suppose this balance is upset for some reason such as a long hike Then your blood draws water from the tissues of your body in order to keep its balance constant As the water is being removed from the tissues it registers in your brain The brain sends a signal to the throat making it contract This contraction makes you feel thirsty Archibald Spooner was well known in England for his slips of the tongue He was a teacher at Oxford University and a clergyman as well Dr Spooner suffered from nervousness and poor eyesight This may have made it difficult for him to see words correctly and to repeat them accurately One time he told a student that he had hissed the mystery lectures when he meant to say missed the history lectures He told another student that the young man had tasted a worm He meant to say that the student had wasted a term Today this particular type of pronunciation error is often called a Spoonerism The last time I went out for breakfast I had to choose among ten types of pancakes six varieties of juice and four kinds of potatoes To my surprise my wife and children love all this They love going into an ice cream shop and being able to choose among seventy five flavors of ice cream and seventy five flavors of topping to put on them For my part I increasingly find that I miss simplicity Faced with a glass case filled with eighteen types of coffee I just wish for a nice cup of tea I m afraid I am the only person in the house who feels that way Some history researchers suggest Marco Polo never actually visited China Why do they say that First they ask why he didn t write about the Great Wall It s hard to miss Then they point out he also failed to mention Chinese tea drinking ceremonies a very important part of life there Moreover no Chinese sources of the period mention Marco Polo although they mention other foreigners Finally some say he never traveled much farther than Turkey Travelers who tried to follow his route always became los t at this point Perhaps he copied details from guidebooks on China Glittering gems called diamonds are among the most precious of human possessions Through the ages they have been a lasting evidence of wealth Lands may lose their soil buildings may be destroyed stocks and bonds may become worthless but the value of diamonds remains relatively unchanged In addition the diamond is the hardest substance ever known Because of this it is of great value for practical use In fact about three fourths of the total annual supply of diamonds is used in factories and machine shops Reporter Where did you get ideas for your fantasy movies Mr Ray Well I had all the fears that a lot of kids have I was frightened of the dark of the wind in the trees I imagined horrible monsters living in my bed Even Snow White gave me a nightmare But as I grew older this kind of fear gradually changed to fascination This fascination gave me inspiration for my movies Reporter How did you get interested in making movies Mr Ray My father had a movie camera He would take pictures of my family At twelve I borrowed my father s camera and started making movies writing scripts for my family and filming family events That s how I started my first movie You know what Actually I didn t ever give that camera back to my father Driving home with my family one day I noticed smoke risen from the roof of an apartment building My father and I raced to the nearest fire station where we told the fire chief and then escorted the fire engines to the apartment Getting no response to their knocks two firemen immediately began smashing down the door with axes I m not sure who was more surprised when they rushed through the apartment the firemen or the three men who were barbecuing on the balcony The Celtic New Year was November The night before was considered a special night when ghosts and witches roamed the earth Ghosts and witches are still associated with Halloween On the night before the Celtic New Year people went from hous e to house begging for food They wore masks so that the spirits returning from the dead would not recognize them Today children still wear masks and trick or treat from door to door on Halloween The Celts also carried lanterns to frighten away the spirits They carved the lanterns from vegetables like potatoes Now pumpkins hold lighted candles on Halloween Many Halloween customs come from the ancient practices of the Celtic people Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature It also is part of the process of selection by which biological evolution functions Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young In some circumstances it may pave the way for genetic variants to take hold in the population of a species and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of the old one Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make possible the good of greater diversity Starvation can be of practical or instrumental value even as it is an intrinsic disvalue What some organisms must starve in nature is deeply regrettable and sad The statement remains implacably true even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends that are good For every toxic substance process or product in use today there is a safer alternative either already in existence or waiting to be discovered through the application of human intellect ingenuity and effort In almost every case the safer alternative is available at a comparable cost Industry may reject these facts and complain about the high cost of acting but history sets the record straight The chemical industry denied that there were practical alternatives to ozone depleting chemicals predicting not only economic disaster but numerous deaths because food and vaccines would spoil without refrigeration They were wrong The motor vehicle industry initially denied that cars caused air pollution then claimed that no technology existed to reduce pollution from vehicles and later argued that installing devices to reduce air pollution would make cars extremely expensive They were wrong every time The pesticide industry argues that synthetic pesticides are absolutely necessary to grow food Thousands of organic farmers are proving them wrong Among the most fascinating natural temperature regulating behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature in their hives or mounds throughout the year The constancy of these microclimates depends not just on the location and insulation of the habitat but on the activity of the insects in the colony When the surrounding temperature increases the activity in the hive decreases which decreases the amount of heat generated by insect metabolism In fact many animals decrease their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold and people who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body temperature This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia and hyperthermia Although most people including Europe s Muslims have numerous identities few of these are politically salient at any moment It is only when a political issue affects the welfare of those in a particular group that identity assumes importance For instance when issues arise that touch on women s rights women start to think of gender as their principal identity Whether such women are American or Iranian or whether they are Catholic or Protestant matters less than the fact that they are women Similarly when famine and civil war threaten people in sub Saharan Africa many African Americans are reminded of their kinship with the continent in which their ancestors originated centuries earlier and they lobby their leaders to provide humanitarian relief In other words each issue calls forth somewhat different identities that help explain the political preferences people have regarding those issues Food unites as well as distinguishes eaters because what and how one eats forms much of one s emotional tie to a group identity be it a nation or an ethnicity The famous twentieth century Chinese poet and scholar Lin Yutang remarks Our love for fatherland is largely a matter of recollection of the keen sensual pleasure of our childhood The loyalty to Uncle Sam is the loyalty to American doughnuts and the loyalty to the Vaterland is the loyalty to Pfannkuchen and Stollen Such keen connection between food and national or ethnic identification clearly indicates the truth that cuisine and table narrative occupy a significant place in the training grounds of a community and its civilization and thus eating cooking and talking about one s cuisine are vital to one s unique personality and taste In other words the destiny of a community depends on how well it nourishes its members Modern psychological theory states that the process of understanding is a matter of construction not reproduction which means that the process of understanding takes the form of the interpretation of data coming from the outside and generated by our mind For example the perception of a moving object as a car is based on an interpretation of incoming data within the framework of our knowledge of the world While the interpretation of simple objects is usually an uncontrolled process the interpretation of more complex phenomena such as interpersonal situations usually requires active attention and thought Psychological studies indicate that it is knowledge possessed by the individual that determines which stimuli become the focus of that individual s attention what significance he or she assigns to these stimuli and how they are combined into a larger whole This subjective world interpreted in a particular way is for us the objective world we cannot know any world other than the one we know as a result of our own interpretations Perceptions of forest use and the value of forests as standing timber vary considerably from indigenous peoples to national governments and Western scientists These differences in attitudes and values lie at the root of conflicting management strategies and stimulate protest groups such as the Chipko movement For example the cultivators of the Himalayas and Karakoram view forests as essentially a convertible resource That is under increasing population pressure and growing demands for cultivable land the conversion of forest into cultivated terraces means a much higher productivity can be extracted from the same area Compensation in the form of planting on terrace edges occurs to make up for the clearance This contrasts with the national view of the value of forests as a renewable resource with the need or desire to keep a forest cover over the land for soil conservation and with a global view of protection for biodiversity and climate change purposes irrespective of the local people s needs For indigenous peoples forests serve as a source of transformable resources while national and global perspectives prioritize the preservation of forests despite the local needs c As a couple start to form a relationship they can be seen to develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and in particular how it is similar or different to their parents relationship The couple s initial disclosures involve them forming constructs about how much similarity there is between them and each other s families What each of them will remember is selective and coloured by their family s constructs system In turn it is likely that as they tell each other their already edited stories there is a second process of editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again interpreted within their respective family of origin s construct systems The two sets of memories the person talking about his or her family and the partner s edited version of this story go into the cooking pot of the couple s new construct system Subsequently one partner may c randomly recall a part of the other s story as a tactic in negotiations for example Harry may say to Doris that she is being bossy just like her mother Since this is probably based on what Doris has told Harry this is likely to be a very powerful tactic She may protest or attempt to rewrite this version of her story thereby possibly adding further material that Harry could use in this way These exchanges of stories need not always be employed in such malevolent ways These reconstructed memories can become very powerful to a point where each partner may become confused even about the simple factual details of what actually did happen in their past One unspoken truth about creativity it isn t about wild talent so much as it is about productivity To find a few ideas that work you need to try a lot that don t It s a pure numbers game Geniuses don t necessarily have a higher success rate than other creators they simply do more and they do a range of different things They have more successes and more failures That goes for teams and companies too It s impossible to generate a lot of good ideas without also generating a lot of bad ideas The thing about creativity is that at the outset you can t tell which ideas will succeed and which will fail So the only thing you can do is try to fail faster so that you can move onto the next idea Let me spend a moment on the idea of adjusting to another person s mental orientation What I mean is this At any moment a person has a particular take on what is happening The person notices this rather than that and she has feelings and makes judgements about one rather than another aspect of events If she is hungry for example she may notice that a shop is selling groceries her friend may notice only that it sells newspapers If she is short of money she may resent that the fruit is overpriced meanwhile her friend may feel tempted by some juicy peaches In one sense the two friends are experiencing the same shop and its contents but they are having quite different experiences of that shop A more extreme case arises when one person comprehends things in a peculiar and individual way for instance in mistaking the shop for a cinema Externalization is the foundation from which many narrative conversations are built This requires a particular shift in the use of language Often externalizing conversations involve tracing the influence of the problem in a child s life over time and how the problem has disempowered the child by limiting his ability to see things in a different light The counsellor helps the child to change by deconstructing old stories and reconstructing preferred stories about himself and his life To help the child to develop a new story the counsellor and child search for times when the problem has not influenced the child or the child s life and focus on the different ways the child thought felt and behaved These exceptions to the problem story help the child create a new and preferred story As a new and preferred story begins to emerge it is important to assist the child to hold on to or stay connected to the new story The narratives that people create to understand their landscapes come to be viewed as marketable entities and a source of income for residents Landscapes with a strong place identity have an advantage in marketing to tourists as it is relatively easy to compartmentalize and market their narratives Such places may have disadvantages as well however If place identity is tied to a particular industry local residents may feel strongly attached to the definitions of place that stem from involvement in that industry and they may resist losing that identity in favor of one based on a tourism industry People rooted in landscape may feel strong connections to other community members and may resent the invasion of outsiders who they believe are different and challenge their common identity Finally local residents may feel that this process reduces their identities to mere commercial transactions and they may believe they sacrifice what is unique and special about their place The weakness of local networks lies in their self containment for they lack input as well as outreach In a classic study of urban politics Herbert Gans found that neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city It was for this reason that Gans referred to them as urban villagers As the opposite of local networks cosmopolitan networks offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and sustain members But members benefit from a constant flow of new information and from the great reach of their influence even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in strength Local networks tend to be small In contrast cosmopolitan networks can be huge Thus while the urban villagers lacked ties even to their local city government cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the White House Unlike the urban villagers whose loose ties to the outside restrict them within their boundaries cosmopolitan networks profit from exposure to new information and a more extensive range of relationships An ecosystem that is altered or damaged in some way will be out of balance with the biome for that area For example if the local biome is forest but the trees have been removed from one area then the ecosystem is out of balance The natural tendency is for plant species to move into that area bringing the ecosystem back towards the biome state The spread of a species into a new area is called colonisation It can happen naturally only if there are ecologically healthy ecosystems nearby to provide plant seeds Once the vegetation has started to recover insects birds and other animals will travel into the newly regenerated area These processes of ecological colonisation can be supported by environmental management For example we are currently seeing important changes in the way agriculture is carried out in Britain Rather than just maximising food production farming is becoming more environmentally friendly with the support of financial subsidies This new approach increases biological diversity by conserving hedges and the wildflowers insects birds and other animals that live on the land A proportion of agricultural land is left completely uncultivated so that species can gradually colonise it This provides a habitat for a wider range of species Leaving some farmland as set aside is also a way to decrease overall production when that is economically desirable Note that set aside land is more permanent than fallow land which is usually left for only a year Colonisation is a slow process taking place over years or even decades A sleeping mother has the ability to identify the particular cry of her own baby This is one of the bonding factors that has been forgotten because of the way in which we live today Typically there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment so there is no way to test this ability In an ancient tribe however living in small huts in a tiny village settlement a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food she might get no sleep at all During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby This sensitivity is still there to this day even though it is seldom used When people try to control situations that are essentially uncontrollable they are inclined to experience high levels of stress Thus suggesting that they need to take active control is bad advice in those situations What they need to do is to accept that some things are beyond their control Similarly teaching people to accept a situation that could readily be changed could be bad advice sometimes the only way to get what you want is to take active control Research has shown that when people who feel helpless fail to take control they experience negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression Like stress these negative emotions can damage the immune response We can see from this that health is not linearly related to control For optimum health people should be encouraged to take control to a point but to recognize when further control is impossible A good deal of the information stored in working memory is encoded in an auditory form especially when the information is language based For example in an early study by Conrad adults were shown six letter sequences with letters being presented visually one at a time at intervals of three fourths of a second As soon as the last letter of a sequence had been presented participants in the study wrote down all six of the letters they had seen guessing at any letters they couldn t easily recall When people recalled letters incorrectly the letters they said they had seen were more likely to resemble the actual stimuli in terms of how the letters sounded than how they looked For example the letter F was remembered as the auditorially similar letter S times but as the visually similar letter P only times Similarly the letter V was remembered as B times but as X only times Even if it is correct to say that we express and represent our thoughts in language it may be a big mistake to suppose that there are structural similarities between what is doing the representing and what is represented Robert Stalnaker in his book Inquiry suggests an analogy with the representation of numbers The number can be represented as but it does not follow that or subtraction are constituents of the number We could compare a thought and its verbal expression with toothpaste and its expression from a tube That the result of expressing toothpaste is a long thin cylinder does not entail that toothpaste itself is long thin or cylindrical Similarly a thought might get expressed out loud in a statement with a particular linguistic structure It does not follow that the thought itself has such a structure Suppose for example that I look at a fruit bowl and think that there is an apple and an orange in that bowl The objects in front of my eyes include some pieces of fruit and a bowl but no object corresponding to the word and exists either in the world or in my visual image In science one experiment whether it succeeds or fails is logically followed by another in a theoretically infinite progression According to the underlying myth of modern science this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future In the arts by contrast no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better Given the methodologies of science the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works nobody ever would have written them While scientific knowledge is believed to progress through successive experiments an artistic work tends to be unique to its creator with no limitless sequence implied Three composers attended a show at the Caf Concert des Ambassadeurs There they heard performances of a song written by one of them and a sketch written by the other two After the performance the three refused to pay their bill telling the owner of the caf You use the products of our labour without paying us for it So there s no reason why we should pay for your service The case went to court and the composers won on appeal The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works This decision created a new category of legal right the performing right and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner As a result of the decision these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights In doing so they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights based on the fact that with the possible exception of opera performances it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers bands promoters or in the twentieth century broadcasters Accordingly the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use issuing licences to music users negotiating fees collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people s businesses Early human societies were nomadic based on hunting and gathering and in a shifting pattern of life in search of new sources of food qualities such as lightness portability and adaptability were dominant criteria With the evolution of more settled rural societies based on agriculture other characteristics other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life rapidly emerged It must be emphasized however that tradition was not static but constantly subject to minute variations appropriate to people and their circumstances Although traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and subtle ways to suit individual users needs A chair could keep its basic accepted characteristics while still being closely shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific person This basic principle of customization allowed a constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced which if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous could be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition Investigators as a personality type place a high value on science process and learning They excel at research using logic and the information gained through their senses to conquer complex problems Nothing thrills them more than a big find Intellectual introspective and exceedingly detail oriented investigators are happiest when they re using their brain power to pursue what they deem as a worthy outcome They prefer to march to their own beat and they dislike overly structured environments that necessitate a set response to challenges Investigators are not interested in leadership and developing the interpersonal skills necessary to fuel collaboration is a hurdle for many of them They may feel insecure in their ability to keep up in their fields and can react badly when forced to put more important work on hold to complete a task that doesn t intrigue them It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link For instance there is a high degree of correlation between shoe size and vocabulary size people with larger shoe sizes tend to have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe sizes But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a larger vocabulary nor does having a large vocabulary cause your feet to grow The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults and because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older it is hardly surprising that on average people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies In other words foot size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of features of the process of human development from infancy to adulthood a cause which both observed phenomena have in common Feedback is usually most effective when you offer it at the earliest opportunity particularly if your objective is to teach someone a skill For example if you are teaching your friend how to make your famous egg rolls you provide a step by step commentary as you watch your pupil If he makes a mistake you don t wait until the egg rolls are finished to tell him that he left out the cabbage He needs immediate feedback to finish the rest of the sequence successfully Sometimes however if a person is already sensitive and upset about something delaying feedback can be wise Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good Rather than automatically offering immediate correction use the just in time approach and provide feedback just before the person might make another mistake Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of their ecosystem than others Such species called keystone species are vital in determining the nature and structure of the entire ecosystem The fact that other species depend on or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed when the keystone species is removed It is in this sense that we should draw attention to fig trees Different species of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain forests Although figs collectively produce a continuous crop of fruits fruit eating monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large quantities of figs in their diets During the time of year when other fruits are less plentiful however fig trees become important in sustaining fruit eating vertebrates Should the fig trees disappear most of the fruit eating vertebrates would be eliminated Protecting fig trees in such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates will survive As a keystone species in tropical rain forests fig trees support fruit eating animals survival when other fruits are insufficien and thus preserve their ecosystem True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of context The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is a telling example At the zoo visitors may witness a great beast pacing behind the bars of its cage They may observe and admire the creature its amazing bone structure and its magnificent coat However no matter how long visitors spend in front of that cage they will never truly understand the beast True understanding can only come from seeing the creature in its natural surroundings and in turn the ways in which its presence affects its environment What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true of science To fully understand science it must be considered within the society in which it functions Science is not conducted in a vacuum It is embedded within a social fabric and just as a flesh and blood beast influences and is influenced by its environment so too do science and society mutually influence one another Society through ethical and economic constraints exerts a powerful influence on what science accomplishes At the same time the results of science have profound and sometimes unexpected impacts on every human being on earth Therefore to make sense of science related issues it is critical to recognize the bidirectional relationship between science and society Not all interesting discoveries have an obvious application If you believe you have something but you re not sure what exactly it s going to be good for don t give up Many innovations languished in labs for years until they were matched to a product Teflon an extremely slippery synthetic substance employed as a coating on cooking utensils was invented in but it didn t coat its first pan till The Post it note was built on the back of some not very good glue Its inventor believed it might have value but it took him five years to find a potentially profitable use for it HP had a breakthrough with a super accurate thermometer that was created in the HP Labs Despite its accuracy there was no clear use for the device until it was used to measure fluctuations in ocean temperature Empathy is a character trait that we value in ourselves and in our friends colleagues and the professionals who serve us The know how to be empathetic is central to practical wisdom unless we can understand how others think and feel it s difficult to know the right thing to do But empathy has its dark side too much understanding and sensitivity too much seeing things from the other s perspective can cloud judgment and paralyze choice Edmund Pellegrino a scholar of bioethics explains it like this If a physician identifies too closely as co sufferer with the patient she loses the objectivity essential to the most precise assessment of what is wrong of what can be done and of what should be done to meet those needs Excessive co suffering also impedes and may even paralyze the physician into a state of inaction Bees have their choice of flora according to color Lord Avenbury once made an experiment to see if the color of flowers attracted bees Placing honey on slips of paper of different shades he found that the insects which visited them seemed to have a marked preference for blue after which came white yellow red green and orange This finding should be considered for our beekeeping planning If pollination is the prime consideration of taming bees and if the crop is identified the color of other floras nearby should be considered while planning Let us consider beekeeping near a mustard field Mustard gives tiny yellow flowers full of nectar and pollen For better yield of mustard seeds pollination is necessary But if there is plenty of blue colored wild flora nearby bees may prefer the blue flowers to mustard Although we shall get honey and other products the objective for pollination of mustard may be defeated In the mid s John Kenneth Galbraith shocked the field of economics when he insisted that consumers do not merely participate in the marketplace they are also the product of the systematic deployment of power throughout society Within this deployment of power commercial media ensures that consumers adopt values and beliefs that match the general requirements of the economy The individual s participation in mass behavior patterns is not a spontaneous reaction to random forces Consumers engage in shared patterns of consumption because they live within an economic system that operates as a belief system It exercises considerable control over the meaning and value of things When the economy functions as a belief system it establishes severe limits on a consumer s free choice As consumers our choices are not entirely our own Our beliefs values thoughts and emotions are highly conditioned to match the needs of the marketplace Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits the mind by catching the reader s attention and triggering moments of self reflection The brain activity of volunteers was monitored as they read classical works These same texts were then translated into more straightforward modern language and again the readers brains were monitored as they read the words Scans showed that the more challenging prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the readers encountered unusual words surprising phrases or difficult sentence structures This lighting up lasts long enough to shift the brain into a higher gear encouraging further reading The research also found that reading the more challenging version of poetry in particular increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain helping the readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they have read The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self help books Original versions of classical texts are helpful to readers because they contain demanding language that inspires further reading and activates readers self reflection Organisms must compete for resources not only with members of their own species but with members of other species When two species use the same resource and the resource is scarce the species must compete just as if they were members of the same population One of the two species usually turns out to be better at the competition If two species eat exactly the same food for example one of the two will be better at catching it Unless something interferes the inferior competitor loses out and the competitively superior species takes over When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it it is called competitive exclusion Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented from excluding poorer competitors Periodic disturbances such as severe storms battering by drifting logs or underwater landslides can reduce the population of a dominant competitor and give other species a chance Furthermore which species is competitively superior sometimes depends on the conditions On rocky shores in tropical Hong Kong for example foliose leaf like algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively cool winter In the summer heat these forms die out and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from excluding the other and there is a shifting balance between the competing species B B Wood is a material that is widely acknowledged to be environmentally friendly It has been welcome as an alternative material for a long time in building houses instead of cement or bricks However it is not always easy to evaluate the relative merits of one particular material such as wood over another Many species of tree are now endangered including mahogany and teak and deforestation particularly in tropical rainforests has had a severe impact both on local communities and on native plants and wildlife Where wood is harvested and then transported halfway across the globe the associated energy costs are high causing a negative impact on the environment What is more where wood is treated with chemicals to improve fire and pest resistance its healthful properties are compromised B So often we get caught up in the minutiae of our jobs tedious annoyances and struggles that may be temporary roadblocks but feel more like concrete mountains While there s plenty of research that shows that people who work with the muscles above their neck create all kinds of stresses for themselves it s the people who focus on the why of their jobs as opposed to the what and the how who can manage the day to day problems more easily That is if you can define the purpose of your career or feel passionate about the mission of your company you can much more easily handle the occasional server maintenance that disrupts your in box The flip side is that if you re working in any area or company that doesn t align with your own value all the little stuff snowballs into a big ball of daily disasters B People knowingly or unknowingly will take too much even though it is not for anyone s collective or long term good As Hardin put it Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all Consider a traffic jam on a main road going into any big city Each person picks that particular road for the logical reason that it s the fastest route In the beginning each additional car does not slow the traffic down as there is enough room on the road for the additional drivers At some point however each car reduces the average speed and eventually there are so many drivers that the traffic slows to a crawl All the people seeking to minimize their own driving time add up to a longer commute for everyone Doing what s rational results in a negative outcome to the collective interest of all drivers including you On a global scale the same thing can befall environmental issues such as overfished seas and rivers air pollution and water scarcity B Researchers asked college student volunteers to think through a fantasy version of an experience looking attractive in a pair of high heeled shoes winning an essay contest or getting an A on a test and then evaluated the fantasy s effect on the subjects and on how things unfolded in reality When participants envisioned the most positive outcome their energy levels as measured by blood pressure dropped and they reported having a worse experience with the actual event than those who had conjured more realistic or even negative visions To assess subjects real life experiences the researchers compared lists of goals that subjects had set for themselves against what they had actually accomplished and also relied on self reports When we fantasize about it especially when you fantasize something very positive it s almost like you are actually living it says one of the study s co authors That tricks the mind into thinking the goal has been achieved draining the incentive to get energized to go and get it she explains Subjects may be better off imagining how to surmount obstacles instead of ignoring them B When confronted by a seemingly simple pointing task where their desires are put in conflict with outcomes chimpanzees find it impossible to exhibit subtle selfserving cognitive strategies in the immediate presence of a desired reward However such tasks are mastered when an alternative symbol system is employed In one study chimps were confronted by a simple choice two plates holding tasty food items were presented each with a different number of treats If the chimp pointed to the plate having more treats it would immediately be given to a fellow chimp in an adjacent cage and the frustrated subject would receive the smaller amount After hundreds and hundreds of trials these chimps could not learn to withhold pointing to the larger reward However these same chimps had already been taught the symbolic concept of simple numbers When those numbers were placed on the plates as a substitute for the actual rewards the chimps promptly learned to point to the smaller numbers first thereby obtaining the larger rewards for themselves B After making a choice the decision ultimately changes our estimated pleasure enhancing the expected pleasure from the selected option and decreasing the expected pleasure from the rejected option If we were not inclined to update the value of our options rapidly so that they concur with our choices we would likely second guess ourselves to the point of insanity We would ask ourselves again and again whether we should have chosen Greece over Thailand the toaster over the coffee maker and Jenny over Michele Consistently second guessing ourselves would interfere with our daily functioning and promote a negative effect We would feel anxious and confused regretful and sad Have we done the right thing Should we change our mind These thoughts would result in a permanent halt We would find ourselves literally stuck overcome by indecision and unable to move forward On the other hand reevaluating our alternatives after making a decision increases our commitment to the action taken and keeps us moving forward B Traditionally we have assessed mathematics ability based on the number of correct answers on a page full of computational problems Learning and memorizing facts therefore was the key component to the mathematics instructional program Recently however many teachers have started placing a greater emphasis on mathematical understanding problem solving hands on experiences and collaborative work This change in the instructional program can be attributed to well informed teachers and the work of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Now teachers should realize that their students will be using mathematics in a world where calculators computers and other forms of technology are readily available Therefore the application of mathematics rather than mere fact acquisition is what will be expected of them in the workplace and in life and consequently mathematics instruction should mirror this real life application B During the s researchers began to suggest that human vulnerability to hazards rather than the hazards themselves was central to understanding the importance of hazards particularly when considering that a city is a geographical focus for large populations Further it was reported that human and material losses from disasters had increased during the th century This happened at a time when cities in the developing world were growing at unprecedented rates bringing together large populations of low income urban residents often on hazardous spontaneous settlements which made them far more vulnerable to natural and human induced hazards It is precisely this issue of vulnerability on which a number of social scientists focused arguing that although floods landslides and earthquakes are natural processes the disasters that can be associated with them are not a result of natural processes but of human vulnerability With the dramatic growth of cities in developing countries environmental hazards could turn into disasters for those who are unable to cope with their impacts B If you don t get the kind of information failure provides you ll end up with unrealistic expectations for yourself explains a psychologist You could wind up in a position where failure which has gathered under cover of darkness reveals itself all at once We should hope then for exposure to failure early and often The sociologist Glen Elder proposed that there is a sensitive period for growth late teens through early s during which failures are most beneficial Such a pattern seems to promote the trait sometimes called equanimity We learn that trauma is survivable so we don t plunge too deeply following setbacks Nor conversely do we soar too high on our successes Some businesses in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street make a point of hiring ex pro athletes to their staffs It s not just that their high profile draws business It s because athletes are good at recovering from their failures We needed people who could perform and not get emotionally attached to losses a Chicago oil trader told the New York Times explaining why the firm likes athletes on the trading floor particularly in ugly economic times like these The image is of a rider easy in the saddle Nothing can so surprise her either for good or ill that she ll be knocked off One way to help keep life s slings and arrows from knocking you off course is to ensure your life is multidimensional says Stephen Berglas a California psychologist and personal coach That way a setback in any one area won t mean in your mind that you re a failure categorically Call it spreading your risk across your emotional portfolio or adding another leg to the furniture for balance says Berglas A A Do you remember the childlike joy you felt the last time you found a parking spot at the mall on a crowded day When you finished shopping you may have left the spot with a certain hesitation particularly if someone else was waiting for it Studies have shown that people take longer to leave a parking spot when another driver is waiting even though they predict they will not It s as if the space suddenly becomes more valuable once another person wants it Strictly speaking it is no longer valuable to the person leaving it After all it seems that our brains are so sensitive to loss that once we have been given something we are hesitant to give it up A Wood is a material that is widely acknowledged to be environmentally friendly It has been welcome as an alternative material for a long time in building houses instead of cement or bricks However it is not always easy to deny the cost advantage of one particular material such as wood over another Many species of tree are now endangered including mahogany and teak and deforestation particularly in tropical rainforests has had a severe impact both on local communities and on native plants and wildlife Where wood is harvested and then transported halfway across the globe the associated energy costs are high causing a negative impact on the environment What is more where wood is treated with chemicals to improve fire and pest resistance its healthful properties are compromised A Human farmers and their domesticated plants and animals made a grand bargain though the farmers did not realize it at the time Consider maize Domestication made it dependent on man But its association with humans also carried maize far beyond its origins as a little known Mexican grass so that it is now one of the most widely planted crops on earth From mankind s point of view meanwhile the domestication of maize made available an abundant new source of food But its cultivation like that of other plants prompted people to adopt a new lifestyle based on farming Is man taking advantage of maize for his own purposes or is maize taking advantage of man Domestication it seems is a two way street A Pride is a sense that I am better than others I have the ultimate beauty talent and answers and I alone should rule the world Pride causes individuals to be out of touch with the reality of who they truly are and of what really brings happiness Pride prevents individuals from experiencing their true value or the true value of others A sense of self worth on the other hand provides calmness and enjoyment when dealing with all kinds of individuals When individuals have a true sense of self worth they do not need to compare themselves with others to tear others apart or feel superior Instead there is an experience of oneness and sharing By recognizing where one s true value lies one simultaneously recognizes the true value of others A Effective communication is vital to achieving wellness because our daily interactions with others are important factors in our emotional health People who have developed a high degree of communication skills are more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in their personal relationships than non communicators Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes from our close relationships which are the main source of our emotional health Close relationships develop when two people can exchange emotional messages easily and effectively Whether we develop effective communication skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on how we learn to communicate For example interaction between parents and their children is often important in determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of interaction Good parents listen to their children and allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness Children raised in households that foster communication find it easier to talk to others about their disappointments fears frustrations and other emotions later in life Such individuals find that they ultimately have better emotional health When we behave irrationally our behavior usually seems reasonable to us When challenged the mind says to itself Why are these people giving me a hard time I m just doing what makes sense Any reasonable person would see that In short we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified As far as we can tell we are only doing what is right and proper and reasonable Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that we might be at fault typically are overcome by more powerful self justifying thoughts I don t mean any harm I m just I m fair It s the others who are wrong It is important to recognize this nature of the human mind as its natural state In other words humans don t have to learn self justifying self serving self deceptive thinking and behavior These patterns are innate in every one of us At some point these days a parent realizes his or her child is tending left The parent panics Will the child be made fun of Struggle with writing Be left out In the past the parent would have done everything possible to exorcise the tendency Today more and more parents shrug their shoulders saying it s okay maybe even something special Or their attempts to discourage it are milder This is not an isolated reaction It s part of the larger trend toward celebrating rather than suppressing individuality in kids From giving children extra time to develop into kindergarteners to accommodating their vegetarian appetites parents today are taking their cues from children rather than the other way around Left handedness is just the tip of the iceberg in today s world parenting is about letting your child develop into his or her own person not about trying to stamp him or her into a mold of conformity It is a common misconception among many musicians and non musicians alike that notes are more important than rests This is not surprising as it is natural to associate music with the sounds that create the melody rather than with the quiet spaces between the notes Because rests are silent people often misinterpret these empty spaces as unimportant But imagine what would happen if a song was made up of only notes and no rests Aside from the fact that the rests would be history pun intended there would be a wall of sound with no reference point or discernible backbone to the music This is because the spaces between the sounds provide a baseline and contrast for the piece and give music structure and texture In fact it is a common saying among experienced musicians that a full measure of rest can hold more music than a full measure of blistering notes Cost estimates follow from time estimates simply by multiplying the hours required by the required labor rates Beware of coordination problems where multiple crafts are involved For example one major company has a policy that requires the following personnel in order to remove an electric motor a tinsmith to remove the cover an electrician to disconnect the electrical supply a millwright to unbolt the mounts and one or more laborers to remove the motor from its mount That situation is fraught with inefficiency and high labor costs since all four trades must be scheduled together with at least three people watching while the fourth is at work The cost will be at least four times what it could be and is often greater if one of the trades does not show up on time Guys lost on unfamiliar streets often avoid asking for directions from locals We try to tough it out with map and compass Admitting being lost feels like admitting stupidity This is a stereotype but it has a large grain of truth It s also a good metaphor for a big overlooked problem in the human sciences We re trying to find our way around the dark continent of human nature We scientists are being paid to be the bus driving tour guides for the rest of humanity They expect us to know our way around the human mind but we don t So we try to fake it without asking the locals for directions We try to find our way from first principles of geography theory and from maps of our own making empirical research The roadside is crowded with locals and their brains are crowded with local knowledge but we are too arrogant and embarrassed to ask the way So we drive around in circles inventing and rejecting successive hypotheses about where to find the scenic vistas that would entertain and enlighten the tourists One day as he walked through the streets of London Thomas Hobbes the seventeenth century philosopher came upon an old sickly man who was begging for money Hobbes his heart touched immediately gave the man a generous offering When asked by a friend if he would have done the same had there been no religious dictum or philosophical principle about helping the needy Hobbes replied that he would His explanation he felt some pain himself when he saw the man s misery and so just as giving money to the man would relieve some of the man s suffering it does also ease me This tale suggests that we have a bit of self interest in relieving the misery of others One school of modern economic theory following Hobbes argues that people give to charities in part because of the pleasure they get from imagining either the relief of those they benefit or their own relief from alleviating their sympathetic distress While there are aesthetic and ethical reasons for preserving biodiversity there are practical considerations as well We depend on many other species for food clothing shelter oxygen soil fertility the list goes on and on In the United States of all prescriptions from pharmacies contain substances derived from plants For instance two substances effective against Hodgkin s disease and certain other forms of cancer come from the rosy periwinkle a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar Madagascar alone harbors some species of flowering plants Unfortunately Madagascar has lost of its forests and about of its native species Madagascar s dilemma represents that of much of the developing world The island is home to over million people most of whom are desperately poor and hardly in a position to be concerned with environmental conservation Yet the people of Madagascar as well as others around the globe could derive vital benefits from the biodiversity that is being destroyed Many of us believe that amnesia or sudden memory loss results in the inability to recall one s name and identity This belief may reflect the way amnesia is usually portrayed in movies television and literature For example when we meet Matt Damon s character in the movie The Bourne Identity we learn that he has no memory for who he is why he has the skills he does or where he is from He spends much of the movie trying to answer these questions However the inability to remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in reality Amnesia most often results from a brain injury that leaves the victim unable to form new memories but with most memories of the past intact While media often depict amnesia as a failure to retrieve past memories especially one s identity most cases of amnesia actually leave the sufferers unable to construct new memories with most memories of the past undamaged Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days which you would think is a good thing But the very reversibility of our romantic commitments has only worsened our problem because that also undermines our satisfaction with our choices To see this you only need to look at a study of a group of college students in a photography class The students made a print of their two best photographs They were then told that they could choose one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file as an example of their work Then the teacher added a twist One group was told that their choice was final Whatever they chose they could not change their minds later The other group was told that they could switch photographs if they changed their minds In a survey taken later students who were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less than the other students Why this paradoxical result According to one researcher the brain has a kind of built in defense system that works to make us satisfied with choices that cannot be undone Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change our minds it appears that we are happier with our choices if we think they can t be changed which means we would be better off if we made romantic commitments more permanent and more difficult to break rather than less Science is making the future and nations are busy making future scientists The more science that emerges from this investment the greater the need for us to follow the gist of the science with sufficient understanding In other words if we the ordinary people are to keep pace with science we need more science writers and more science writing that is clear wise and eloquent and that demands to be read People often feel excluded from science convinced that it takes an advanced degree to understand what scientists do As a result they defensively shrug off the whole business as an exclusive realm of little relevance to their lives One of the surest cures for scientific illiteracy is great scientific literature writing that does not merely translate technical terms into plain English or explain complicated ideas simply Variety is the spice of life If I assign fifty students a five page essay on the subject of why the Roman Empire fell most of them are likely to say it was a combination of economic and social causes ultimately leading to a weakening of the frontiers This would be a fine answer but after reading forty five papers all saying the same thing I m ready for a change If you can take a different angle from the rest of the class in a paper you re more likely to impress your professors But here s the tricky part being different is risky and it only works if you back up your argument very well If you choose to argue that Rome fell solely because Christianity weakened the fighting spirit of the Romans you will need persuasive reasoning and arguments against any potential objections Consumers of different age groups obviously have very different needs and wants Although people who belong to the same age group differ in many other ways they do tend to share a set of values and common cultural experiences that they carry throughout life In some cases marketers initially develop a product to attract one age group and then try to broaden its appeal later on That is what the high octane energy drink Reddox does The company aggressively introduced it in bars nightclubs and gyms to the product s core audience of young people Over time it became popular in other contexts and the company began to sponsor the PGA European Tour to expand its reach to older golfers It also hands out free cans to commuters cab drivers and car rental agencies to promote the drink as a way to stay alert on the road Difficulty in assessing information is aggravated by the overabundance of information at our disposal While this is obvious enough in some realms for example consider how much information is potentially relevant for estimating the value of Microsoft stock even when the information set seems less cluttered information overload a state of confusion and decision avoidance can still occur In one experiment shoppers in a supermarket were presented with free samples of jams and jellies In the first treatment a small selection was available for tasting in the second a large selection was available While everyone likes the idea of abundant choice and indeed the table with the greater selection attracted larger crowds it was the table with fewer samples that led to the most sales The likely reason is that the large selection led to information overload the feeling that the decision was too complicated for immediate action The essence of science is to uncover patterns and regularities in nature by finding algorithmic compressions of observations But the raw data of observation rarely exhibit explicit regularities Instead we find that nature s order is hidden from us it is written in code To make progress in science we need to crack the cosmic code to dig beneath the raw data and uncover the hidden order I often liken fundamental science to doing a crossword puzzle Experiment and observation provide us with clues but the clues are cryptic and require some considerable ingenuity to solve With each new solution we glimpse a bit more of the overall pattern of nature As with a crossword so with the physical universe we find that the solutions to independent clues link together in a consistent and supportive way to form a coherent unity so that the more clues we solve the easier we find it to fill in the missing features Like an artist who pursues both enduring excellence and shocking creativity great companies foster a tension between continuity and change On the one hand they adhere to the principles that produced success in the first place yet on the other hand they continually evolve modifying their approach with creative improvements and intelligent adaptation But the point here is not as simple as some companies failed because they did not change Companies that change constantly but without any consistent rationale will collapse just as surely as those that change not at all There is nothing inherently wrong with adhering to specific practices and strategies But you should comprehend the underlying why behind those practices and thereby see when to keep them and when to change them Since most of you are working on a word processor it seems silly to spend too much time on spelling Your word processing program will spell check items for you However spelling is not a completely lost art There are words that are not in the spell checker s dictionary Also your spell checker will not help you if you misspell a word and mistakenly turn it into another word For example when you write lightening instead of lightning the program will not recognize the error So get in the habit of rereading your work and looking up words that the spell checker does not pick up You need to develop the skill of knowing when words look wrong Never hand something in until you have checked it A bumper sticker reading Don t Believe Everything You Think is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in Greene s office It represents the underlying message of the book he is writing An analogy carried throughout the book compares the moral brain to a camera with automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or an indoor portrait or a close up of a flower and manual settings for unusual conditions or when we want a nonstandard artistic effect Greene believes emotions and intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while reasoning is the manual mode We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we could not function But they are not always trustworthy moral indicators since they were set to handle problems deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for the newer complexities of the modern world We need to rely on our manual settings the reasoning sections of our brain for more complex or novel situations Greene says According to Greene s view on the moral brain emotions and intuitions make our lives easier in making everyday decisions but we need to rely on reasoning for more complex problems The McDonald s restaurants that are located across the United States and increasingly the world have a significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick hamburgers milk shakes and salads As sociologist George Ritzer says our everyday lives are being McDonaldized The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to the robotlike assembly of food This term refers to the standardization of everyday life a process that is transforming our lives Want to do some shopping Shopping malls offer one stop shopping in controlled environments Planning a trip Travel agencies offer package tours They will transport middle class Americans to ten European capitals in fourteen days All visitors experience the same hotels restaurants and other scheduled sites Efficiency brings dependability You can expect your burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them in Los Angeles or Beijing Although efficiency also lowers prices it does come at a cost Predictability washes away spontaneity changing the quality of our lives It produces a sameness a bland version of what used to be unique experiences In my own travels for example had I taken packaged tours I never would have had the eye opening experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of human diversity For good or bad our lives are being McDonaldized and the predictability of packaged settings seems to be our social destiny Our coming prepackaged society will be efficient of course But it also means that we will be trapped in the iron cage of bureaucracy just as Weber warned would happen Errors and failures typically corrupt all human designs Indeed the failure of a single component of your car s engine could force you to call for a tow truck Similarly a tiny wiring error in your computer s circuits can mean throwing the whole computer out Natural systems are different though Throughout Earth s history an estimated million to million species have disappeared which means that this year somewhere between three and a hundred species will vanish However such natural extinctions appear to cause little harm Over millions of years the ecosystem has developed an amazing insensitivity to errors and failures surviving even such drastic events as the impact of the Yucatan meteorite which killed tens of thousands of species Unlike deviance in other settings deviance in sports often involves an unquestioned acceptance of and extreme conformity to norms and expectations For example most North Americans see playing football as a positive activity Young men are encouraged to be all they can be as football players and to live by slogans such as There is no I in t e a m They are encouraged to increase their weight and strength so that they can play more effectively and contribute to the success of their teams When young men go too far in their acceptance of expectations to become bigger and stronger when they are so committed to playing football and improving their skills on the field that they use muscle building drugs they become deviant This type of overdoing it deviance is dangerous but it is grounded in completely different social dynamics from the dynamics that occur in the antisocial deviance enacted by alienated young people who reject commonly accepted rules and expectations Time pressure leads to frustration and when we are frustrated or experience other negative emotions our thinking becomes narrower and less creative However people are unaware of this phenomenon and live under the illusion that when they are experiencing time pressure they are also more creative This explains why time pressure is pervasive and to some extent accounts for the increase in rates of depression We are generally too busy trying to squeeze more and more activities into less and less time Consequently we fail to enjoy potential sources of happiness that may be all around us To enjoy the richness that life has to offer we need to take our time With no attempt there can be no failure and with no failure no humiliation So our self esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities Thus success divided by pretensions equals self esteem This illustrates how every rise in our levels of expectation entails a rise in the dangers of humiliation What we understand to be normal is critical in determining our chances of happiness It also hints at two ways for raising our self esteem On the one hand we may try to achieve more and on the other we may reduce the number of things we want to achieve The advantages of the latter approach lie in the following statement To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified For many people nature is defined as a negative It exists where people do not Nature lies outside the urban and agricultural realms in regions of Earth where natural processes are unhindered Nature is where fallen logs rot and acorns grow wildfires turn woodlands into meadows and barrier islands shift with the currents all without human interference By extension this definition suggests that nature is best protected by keeping humans far away so that it can continue to run itself But there is a serious problem with this view If nature is defined as a landscape uninfluenced by humankind then there is no nature on the planet at all Prehistoric peoples changed their surrounding ecosystems whether by installing orchards in the Amazon or by hunting many large mammals to extinction in North America And modern humans are changing the global environment even more profoundly whether through planet wide climate change or by the worldwide movement of synthetic chemicals through the food chain The most obvious salient feature of moral agents is a capacity for rational thought This is an uncontested necessary condition for any form of moral agency since we all accept that people who are incapable of reasoned thought cannot be held morally responsible for their actions However if we move beyond this uncontroversial salient feature of moral agents then the most salient feature of actual flesh and blood as opposed to ridiculously idealized individual moral agents is surely the fact that every moral agent brings multiple perspectives to bear on every moral problem situation That is there is no one size fits all answer to the question What are the basic ways in which moral agents wish to affect others Rather moral agents wish to affect others in different ways depending upon who these others are Many grocery stores give the shopper the option of paper or plastic grocery bags Many people instinctively say that paper is less harmful to the environment after all paper is biodegradable and recyclable In contrast most plastic is manufactured using oil by products and natural gas Plastic is not always easily or economically recyclable and once manufactured plastic may last virtually indefinitely Yet in the United States paper products are the single largest component of municipal waste Even though paper products may theoretically be biodegradable in most landfills they do not biodegrade Furthermore paper production emits air pollution specifically percent more pollution than the production of plastic bags And consider that making paper uses trees that could be absorbing carbon dioxide The paper bag making process also results in three times more water pollutants than making plastic bags The information processing model emphasizes rational analysis for solving problems with an emphasis on techniques for quickly arriving at a solution Culturally this orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which are normally valued by contemporary Western societies For example Westerners tend to admire someone who is independent and quick thinking But these characteristics are not universally valued Agricultural African societies for example valued looking at the problem in the context of the whole society noting its impact on various features of life In most situations speed in arriving at a solution was not a vital issue This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in Canada These groups historically lived in wilderness areas and faced many hardships in these circumstances they would rarely get a second chance at solving problems Consequently these Native people value taking time to reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible solutions before any action is taken In modern Western societies speed is highly valued in problem solving whereas it is viewed differently in some non Western societies due to their cultural backgrounds The other day an acquaintance of mine a sociable and charming man told me he had found himself unexpectedly alone in New York for an hour or two between appointments He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the empty time looking at things by himself For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone What had he been afraid of I asked myself That suddenly alone he would discover that he bored himself or that there was quite simply no self there to meet But having taken the first step into this new world he is now about to begin a new adventure he is about to be launched into his own inner space space as immense unexplored and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut His every perception will come to him with a new freshness and for a time seem startlingly original For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes for a moment or two something of a genius With another human being present vision becomes double vision inevitably We are busy wondering what does my companion see or think of this and what do I think of it The original impact gets lost Music I heard with you was more than music Exactly And therefore music itself can only be heard alone Solitude is the salt of personhood It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience Furniture is among the oldest engineering structures designed to carry a rather well defined load under rather well defined circumstances We are not surprised that furniture used beyond its intended purpose is broken and we readily blame the child who abuses the furniture rather than the designer of the furniture or the furniture itself when it is abused Thus a chair must support a person in a sitting position but it might not be expected to survive a fall from a tall building A child s bed might be expected to support a sleeping child but it would not necessarily be considered badly designed if it collapsed under the child s wild use of it as a trampoline The arms and legs of chairs the heads and feet of beds just like those of the people whom they serve cannot be expected to be strong without limit A vendor in a city set up shop and sold doughnuts and coffee to passersby During the breakfast and lunch hours he always had long lines of customers waiting He noticed that as he was a one man show the biggest bottleneck preventing him from selling more doughnuts and coffee was the disproportionate amount of time it took to make change for his customers Finally he simply put a small basket on the side of his stand filled with dollar bills and coins Most customers responded by being completely honest often leaving him larger than normal tips Also he was able to move customers through at twice the pace because he did not have to make change In addition he found that his customers liked this idea and kept coming back By extending trust in this way he was able to double his sales Few things hold people back more than the fear of rejection They do not ask for what they need because the answer may be no They do not ask their boss for a raise or for more time off They are afraid to be the first to say I love you They do not ask for help from people they do not know well In short they do not let their wants and needs be known because they are afraid of being turned away But the wonderful truth is this If you can accept NO for an answer you can fearlessly ask for whatever you need It is also true that you will not receive if you do not ask So do not be afraid to ask You may be surprised at the number of people willing to help Take a moment to cast your mind back over the past week or so and think about something you regret Was it something you did or something you failed to do It seems that people regret their actions more than their failures to act As an example consider Mary and Laura who invest their money in companies A and B Mary invests in company A and considers switching to company B but she decides not to Laura invests in company B and considers switching to company A and she decides to do so They both find out that they would have been better off by if they had taken different actions Who do you think feels more regret Most people judge that Laura will regret her action more than Mary will regret her inaction The spread of prosperity the single family home the invention of television and computers have all made it possible for us to live private lives unimaginable to previous generations We no longer live in close quarters with our neighbors we can move about without crowding into buses or trains we do not have to go to theaters or share our tastes with our neighbors However the same technologies that help separate us from the crowds also make it possible to monitor and record our behaviors Although fewer people have intimate knowledge of our lives many people mostly unknown to us know something about us The very technology that was supposed to free us from mass society has turned out to be as much a fishbowl as an information highway In modern society we have discovered that being free often means also being naked American culture in general appears suspicious of leisure Some people believe this may be due to the Protestant work ethic Many Americans fill their free time with intellectually or physically demanding hobbies or volunteer work Even on vacation Americans stay in touch with the workplace via their cellular phones and laptop computers On the other hand Europeans hold leisure in high regard A new French law gave France the shortest work week in Europe Companies with more than twenty employees are required to cut work hours from to per week Besides creating more leisure time for workers this move is expected to help ease unemployment In Germany however longer work weeks may soon be the standard Its low birth rate has resulted in fewer workers supporting more and more retired Germans in the generous state welfare system The face of the water in time became a wonderful book a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger but which told its mind to the pilot without reserve delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it spoke them with a voice The passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds To the pilot however it was a highlighted passage Indeed it was more than that for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes and the most frightening to a pilot s eye To the passenger the face of the water reflects beauty whereas to the pilot it reveals danger As we explore together the virtual world that floats on the edge of this material life the many imaginative territories you inhabit bring back another reality I catch images of my own childhood wanderings through Narnia the land of hobbits and Mowgli s jungle All these are deep pleasures which combine all my senses and momentarily transport me into another dimension of living If I were to bring it all together I would say that among all the misery fear injustice and pain I hope you will not forget moments when all this fades away into periods of innocent joy It is when we bring all our powerful senses together perhaps in a moment in the garden of earthly delights that we triumph over despair So the moment when you dance to Handel or when you sit in a pool of wild flowers or gravely take part in your first tea ceremony these are the moments you will treasure They are with similar moments with friends and loved ones what makes being human bearable To watch a play is to step into a world that seems far removed from electronic beeping and ringing Of course this is assuming that theatergoers remember to turn off their cell phones At a theater in Goyang however stage managers have been begging the audience to leave their phones on During the performance everybody is expected to take out their mobiles call into a computer and using their keypads direct the movements of puzzle pieces on the screen behind the stage At some point an ordinary housewife appears on the screen connected from her kitchen via the Internet and interacts with actors on the stage in real time The minute production combines the latest digital technology with live actors audiences and the stage When you choose an item among a number of options the attractive features of the rejected items will decrease the satisfaction derived from the chosen item This is a very important reason why many options can be harmful to our well being Because we do not put rejected items out of our minds we experience the disappointment of having our satisfaction with decisions reduced by all the options we considered but did not choose In light of these negative effects of opportunity cost which is the cost of the opportunity you lost by making one choice instead of another we are tempted to ignore opportunity costs altogether in making decisions Excessive consumption of what Chinese Medicine considers to be cold energy foods and raw foods such as salads ice creams iced drinks or fruit may weaken the spleen This idea runs counter to all modern ideas about diet according to which by eating raw vegetables and fruit we can absorb all the vitamins and minerals contained in them This is true to a certain extent and moderate consumption of these foods can be beneficial However from the Chinese point of view the spleen likes dryness and warmth in food and dislikes excess of liquids and cold An excessive consumption of the above foods will be very difficult to digest and may weaken the spleen Thus particularly those who have a tendency to spleen problems should not consume raw and cold foods in excess We are self centered interpreters of all incoming information At any given moment we may note only one aspect of a current flow of information depending on our view of ourselves our attention and our emotional state in a specific situation Later we may note still other aspects of a similar flow of information Then when an attempt to recall the second moment is confused with the memory of the original moment our brain starts to create a tale to take in different aspects of both the original situation and the second moment We suddenly confuse the two episodes as we begin to put the two sets of events into some kind of memory mixture Alas accurate memories are an ideal not a reality of the human condition The lawyer had a unique place within American society In a country without a landed aristocracy lawyers formed a privileged but public spirited class In every town and city in America they were the leading citizens who helped to build the museums and hospitals formed civic institutions and moved in and out of government at all levels For example James C Carter was a distinguished New York lawyer in the late th century He helped to found the Bar of the City of New York and played a key role in reform movements in the city and the state including the Citizens Union the City Club and the Good Government Clubs In other words his public life took up a good part of his work life And he was not unusual Lawyers like him could be found in New York and in every town in America Anchoring settling to a certain price range influences all kinds of purchases Uri Simonsohn and George Lowenstein for example found that people who move from inexpensive areas to moderately priced cities do not increase their spending to fit the new area Rather these people spend an amount similar to what they were used to in their previous area even if this means having to squeeze themselves and their families into smaller or less comfortable homes Likewise people moving from more expensive cities sink the same amount of dollars into their new housing situations as they did in the past People who move from an expensive area do not generally downsize their spending much once they move to a moderately priced city People who move to a new region generally remain anchored to the prices in their former location When it comes to talking I have observed two basic personality types The first I call the Dead Sea People with this personality type have many experiences emotions and thoughts throughout the day They have a large reservoir where they store that information and they are perfectly happy not to talk On the other extreme is the Babbling Brook For this personality whatever enters into the eye gate or the ear gate comes out the mouth gate Many times a Dead Sea marries a Babbling Brook That happens because when they are dating it is a very attractive match If you are a Dead Sea and you date a Babbling Brook you will have a wonderful evening You do not have to think How will I get the conversation started tonight How will I keep the conversation flowing In fact you do not have to think at all All you have to do is nod your head and say Uh huh and she will fill up the whole evening and you will go home saying What a wonderful person On the other hand if you are a Babbling Brook and you date a Dead Sea you will have an equally wonderful evening because Dead Seas are the world s best listeners You will talk continuously for three hours He will listen intently to you and you will go home saying What a wonderful person You attract each other But five years after marriage the Babbling Brook wakes up one morning and says We ve been married five years and I don t know you The Dead Sea is saying I know you too well I wish you would stop the flow and give me a break The good news is that Dead Seas can learn to talk and Babbling Brooks can learn to listen We are influenced by our personality but not controlled by it Person A Most people access the Internet at public libraries to get information However lawmakers are threatening the democratic mission of libraries by forcing them to use blocking programs These programs prevent access to many services on the Internet including websites dealing with art literature women s health religion and free speech Public libraries should provide information to all What if you cannot afford a home computer and your only choice is to use one at the library If this computer has blocking programs then you are being denied the access that people with home computers have Person B No one can deny that public library Internet access is of great use but there is a serious problem with access to all Internet services at public libraries Some users take advantage of this privilege by sending spam mail using e mail to abuse people and hacking into government and corporate systems Furthermore many innocent children using the Internet without supervision can easily become victims of website operators with criminal intentions The public library is not a private home The most effective way to safeguard Internet users at a public library is through blocking programs Often the best form of communication with friends is surprisingly silence Friendship is not only about what we say but even more importantly about what we do not True friendship occurs when information is conveyed by absences of words The point is to convey as much as possible indirectly between the lines The reason such negative communication is important is that it requires a greater closeness than positive communication The greater the distance between sender and receiver the more the need for directness Only when two or more people share an enormous amount can the much more economical negative communication take place Team performance is not possible if the leader grabs all the best chances assignments and credit for himself or herself Indeed the crucial point of the leader s challenge is to provide performance opportunities to the team members When the Dollus Bank team leader Trevor Canfield made room for a junior investment banker to lead a prestigious account he did just that So did Mike Fangos at Gopak when he encouraged a chemical engineer who could not balance his checkbook at home to take responsibility for preparing the Zebra Team s million budget Stepping out of the way to give opportunities to others however does not mean giving up responsibility for guidance monitoring and control Michel de Montaigne the sixteenth century French essayist loved conversation To my taste he says the most fruitful and natural exercise of our mind is conversation I find the practice of it the most delightful activity in our lives According to Montaigne studying books is a weak mental activity while conversation provides teaching and excercise all at once Montaigne thinks of conversation as an intellectual sporting event that will improve his mind If I am fighting with a strong and solid opponent he will attack me his ideas send mine soaring Rivalry competitiveness and glory will drive me and raise me above my own level Our mind is strengthened by contact with dynamic and well ordered minds Studies regarding our habits of eating out found that when we eat out we tend to underestimate the number of calories we consume by up to half When we eat in a relaxing candle lit restaurant we tend to enjoy our food longer even if we are full Dining with friends also contributes to consuming more calories Researchers found that women who dined with two or three friends ate calories on average double that of solo diners Our psychology is another factor in the consumption of calories A waiter who greeted customers with the question What are we celebrating tonight got more orders than waiters who didn t Therefore if you treat dining as a special occasion you re more likely to eat more Soaring eagles have the incredible ability to see a mouse in the grass from a mile away Similarly cats have the extraordinary ability to see in the dark Through natural s election over time these animals have developed visual systems uniquely adapted to their way of life The human visual system has also adapted to many things well Although our night vis ion is not as good as that of a cat our color vision is excellent This is not a bad tradeoff s ince being able to enjoy a sunset s beauty seems worth an occasional fall in the dark I believe mystery plays a fundamental role in experiencing the great things in life If you can determine the chemicals that exist in a food or wine does that help you understand why you like the taste Do you think that being able to list all the reasons you love a person enables you to love that person more or differently If something is beautiful to you can you really explain why in a meaningful way There are many sensations and feelings that we can experience but not fully define Once we give up the belief that definition of these emotions is necessary or possible we can actually experience them more completely because we have removed the analytical filter we use to find definitions The attempt to analyze things in definite ways prevents us from appreciating them deeply and completely Mel a chimpanzee in Gombe Nigeria was three years old when his mother died He had no elder brother or sister to adopt him To our amazement he was adopted by a twelve year old chimpanzee Spindle who was certainly not related to Mel As weeks passed the two became inseparable Spindle took care of Mel while traveling he permitted the infant to ride on his back even allowed him to hang beneath as a mother carries her baby Most remarkably if Mel got too close to the big males Spindle would hurry to remove his small charge from danger even though this meant he got into trouble himself For a whole year this relationship endured and there was no doubt that Spindle saved Mel s life Why did Spindle act that way burdening himself with the care of a sickly youngster Probably we shall never know but it is interesting to reflect that during the plague that claimed Mel s mother Spindle s mother also died Is it possible that Spindle s loss of his mother left an empty space in his life And that the contact with a dependent baby helped to fill that space Or did Spindle experience an emotion similar to that which we call revenge Perhaps the lonely chimpanzee felt a mixture of both The nineteenth century saw a change of attitude which led to a separation in people s minds of the scientific and the artistic From this period the roles of mathematicians and architects were seen as distinct in a way that did not happen in the seventeenth century This is not to say that the connections between mathematics and architecture disappeared just that the scientific and artistic aspects were seen as complementary skills not to be found in the same person Of course there were still those who did excel in both mathematics and architecture it was only the perceptions that changed I scheduled a meeting with a client for one morning I called the day before to confirm the date and time When I arrived at the client s office the morning of the meeting he looked puzzled What are you doing here Didn t you get my message he asked Here s what happened My client worked late the evening before trying to prepare for our meeting Realizing he wouldn t be ready he sent me an e mail at p m telling me that we needed to reschedule I have a life and I usually don t read e mails in the evening If he had called I would have known not to show up This is a classic case of someone sending an e mail without thinking of the best way to deliver the message to the reader He should have phoned me The word addiction is often used loosely in conversation People will refer to themselves as mystery book addicts or cookie addicts E B White writes of his interest in gardening We are hooked and are making an attempt to keep the habit Yet nobody really believes that reading mystery books or ordering seeds by catalog is serious enough to be compared with addictions to drugs or alcohol The word addiction is here used jokingly to represent a strong desire for some pleasurable activities The price of an autograph depends on how rare it is For example famous people like Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon sign a lot of autographs Therefore their autographs are common and are not worth much On the other hand Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow seldom sign anything This makes their autographs more valuable Similarly Queen Elizabeth almost never signs autographs Therefore something with her signature on it might sell for around It doesn t matter if the person is dead Elvis Presley and Napoleon signed many things Their signatures are only worth The development of dialects mainly results from limited communication between different parts of a community that share one language Under such circumstances changes that take place in the language of one part of the community do not spread elsewhere As a result the speech varieties become more distinct from one another If contact continues to be limited for long enough sufficient changes will accumulate to make the speech varieties mutually unintelligible which usually leads to the recognition of separate languages The different changes that took place in spoken Latin in different parts of the Roman Empire for example eventually gave rise to the modern Romance languages including French Spanish and Italian It is all too easy to assume that everything in life is going to work out perfectly Some people plan their entire lives for years assuming that things will happen exactly as they hope For example some college students begin planning at the beginning of their freshman year what classes they will be taking through graduate school and then where they will end up working The problem is once they fail one class or have a bad experience that leads them to doubt their major all of these plans fall apart In general we should plan the future based on what we expect to happen Unfortunately things do not always work out as we want so we must be prepared for anything Unpredictability of life can force you to change your future plans Person A We must switch to daylight savings By starting the day one hour earlier in the summer people gain an hour of daylight which gives them a longer day for either work or leisure Saving energy is another advantage of setting the clock forward With more sunlight late in the day we can cut down on the use of electricity to be spent on lighting and air conditioning for example Also this new system helps the economy because people would have more time for leisure activities shopping and eating out in the evening Most of the world s economic powers are on this system already so it would be more convenient for international trade and communication Just from these points alone you can see why we should switch to this system Person B We must stick to our current time system because the side effects of switching the clock back and forth one hour twice a year would be disastrous It would not only seriously harm people s bio rhythms and thus cause health problems but also it would slow down work and the nation would lose money from the lowered production Switching time back and forth would be costly for businesses and airlines and be confusing for lots of people We should remember that the nation tried this system about years ago and that it caused so much trouble that we came back to the system we have now which seems to work just fine What s the point of changing the time system that works into the one that is going to be confusing Truly fresh fruits add enormously to the pleasure of eating a healthy diet The freshest ones are those you grow yourself and pick just before you eat them You don t need a farm or a big backyard to do this My backyard is only about feet by feet Yet in this space not far from busy Harvard Square my wife and I have a peach tree a pear tree and an apple tree that yield s everal pounds of fruit a year Our garden gives us something fresh and tasty for at least four months of the year By placing the trees near the edge of the yard and growing grapes on the fence we can still have enjoyable outdoor living space Dieting usually results in failure This is because people want to lose weight too easily and too quickly There is no one easy method of losing weight however At least four components are necessary for any successful program of weight control regular exercise sensible nutrition behavior modification and of course diet Any one of these components will lead to a decrease in total body weight but in combination they will produce more effective results Together they form a master plan for long term permanent weight loss As parents we all have different ideas of what success means for our children I think the most important aspect of success has to do with finding a real passion for something in life It means a responsibility to live up to one s potential That has to be discovered it can t be forced upon a youngster growing up We cannot expect children to be replicas of us From the minute they are born they are already themselves Children must be given the tools and opportunities to go as far as they possibly can do on their own While speed remains something new to mankind it is bound to be in fashion But for my part I like crawling When the roads were still empty of speeding machinery the day seemed twice as long as one passed over the miles so slowly One did not see much of the world in a day but the eye could linger on what one saw If the inventors could have known what they were about to destroy with their inventions surely they would have hesitated before yielding to their genius To pass through a landscape swiftly is almost the same thing as not to have traveled at all Some fishes use their electroceptive s ense for detecting prey and for moving toward or away from objects in the environment Nowhere is prey detection with this sense better developed than in sharks Spiny dogfish sharks the common laboratory specimen locate prey by electroception A shark can detect and eat a flounder that is hiding in the sand and it will locate and eat electric devices that are creating electric signals similar to those emitted by the flounder On the other hand it cannot find a dead flounder buried in the sand or a live flounder covered by a special plastic sheet blocking electric signals Perhaps the outs tanding characteris tic of my nine year old child is the fact that he is emerging from a long strong preoccupation with his mother Whereas at eight he could admit the pres ence of Mother now he often s eems to res ent her pres ence and her demands At eight he counted on his mother Or he was related s trongly and warmly to his mother This nine year old child isn t willing to ask others for help In addition he is eager to achieve something for hims elf He has become a s elf s tarter and once started wishes to continue in his own way at his own time in his own direction My child at nine is more self satisfied and solitary than at eight Dear Andy Thank you most s incerely for the high quality workmanship recently performed on the installation of our roof From the very beginning including the pres entation and estimate the work was done with such professionalism Every concern was well worked out even down to the last detail of cleaning up We found absolutely nothing left behind A next door neighbor was so impress ed that we have referred him to you Thank you again Sincerely J Adams James Adams Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo were thrilled to s ee the first men walk on the moon and return to the earth Words such as fantastic and incr edible were inadequate to describe those eventful days But to go there those as tronauts had to break out of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth More energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift off or in the firs t few miles of travel than was used over the next s everal days to travel half a million miles Habits too have tremendous gravity pull more than most p eop le realize or wou ld admit Break ing deeply rooted old habitual tendencies such as hesitance impatience s elfishness and criticalness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little will power and a few minor changes in our lives Achieving lift off takes a tremendous effort but once we break out of the gravity pull our freedom takes on a whole new world Among all the s ciences mathematics probably has the longes t unbroken history rivaled only by as tronomy Both go back at leas t to the ancient Babylonians and discoveries made then remain important today And just as as tronomy builds on the discoveries of the pas t so does mathematics Astronomy is based on observations of the real world whereas mathematics is a shared social construct of ideas Interestingly however ideas are the driving force of astronomy and mathematics has grown out of attempts to model the real world to count the passing days to measure the sizes of fields and to calculate the taxes owed to the king In as tronomy there have been revolutions Old ideas h ave been overthrow n replaced by radically different new ones For example before the th century people did not doubt that the earth was fixed at the center of the univers e But Copernicus sugges ted that the earth moves around the sun After some objections his idea was accepted by astronomers during the th century It is often said that mathematics cannot have revolutions because the nature of mathematical truth does not change But human attitudes do change and one of the biggest revolutions in mathematics was a major revis ion of our concept of mathematical truth In the next fifty years several major revolutions will be witnes sed in mathematics Imagine you were asked to work overtime and you didn t want to do it Then you were told you would get paid twice as much money You would probably become more cooperative This idea also works with children A few years ago a child of mine wouldn t brush her teeth before going to bed Nothing we did could make her change her mind Then my parenting class teacher recommended that I should give her rewards So I used this simple phrase which worked wonders If you go and brush your teeth now we will have time to read three stories instead of just one Whenever she heard it she would jump up and brush her teeth right away When something doesn t meet our expectations many of us operate on the assumption When in doubt it must be someone els e s fault You can s ee this assumption in action almost everywhere you look the car isn t working properly so the mechanic must have repaired it incorrectly your expenses exceed your income so your husband or wife must be spending too much money However blaming others takes an enormous amount of mental energy It makes you feel powerless over your own life because your happiness depends on the behavior of others which you can t control The pollution of sea air and land harms our quality of life by affecting our health More serious is the possibility of the end of human life itself We may become so developed that we kill ourselves Therefore the most recent definition of development emphasizes sustainable development the improvement of human quality of life within the limits of a green healthy earth In other words it is development which aims to protect not destroy the earth s resources This will make sure that our present lifestyle does not harm future generations lifestyles They will also be able to get fruits from the earth Modern art includes creations that can never be collected owned or exhibited in the traditional sense Often preferring concepts over materials modern artists use materials in the broadest sense As a result they have gone beyond the natural environment Their works use everything from neon lights and computers to the artists own bodies as artistic mediums Artists and art works can therefore become identical as in the case of Body Art On the other hand they can be distant from each other For example an artis t might phone workers in a museum instructing them on how to make a work that he has not seen or touched himself Almost everyone will tell you to write about the things you know best And you may know more than you realize You are the expert on at least one very interesting subject yourself Remember that just as you enjoy reading stories about others your readers will enjoy reading stories about your feelings and about things that happened to you As you think about writing topics don t forget your hobbies and talents As an expert you can give your readers the real facts Maybe some of your readers will be inspired to try a new hobby themselves In recent years we ve been dreaming very different dreams The stuff of these dreams is fantasy swords and wizards knights and ladies The business of fantasy has become a multibillion dollar reality and science fiction is starting to feel old fashioned Our fascination with science fiction reflected a deep faith that technology would lead us to a cyber utopia with robot servants serving food But in fact a dark pessimistic attitude toward technology and the future is attracting more and more people And the evidence is the world s new concern with a nostalgic magical vision of the past swords not lasers magic not electricity villages not cities the past not the future The concern with science fiction is being replaced by a new interest in fantasy When I entered the ninth grade I thought I would have to work very hard and my teachers would be very strict So when the history teacher told us what we were going to study I became confused and tired I stumbled into the English class my head still spinning The first thing the English teacher did was to pass around a tea bag She said I was making my usual cup of tea this morning and I found this strange tea bag It smells of tea and it looks the same as all the other tea bags in the box but there is nothing inside it I d like you to write something using this as a metaphor We got into it right away and came up with some really cool ideas The teacher said tea bags bring good luck so she hung this one above her desk After we had all survived that first day we built an even better relationship with the teacher and we learned a lot And whenever I felt particularly stressed angry or sad I would go sit under the tea bag and talk to her She was definitely a friend as well as a teacher  Monumental is a word that comes very close to expressing the basic characteristic of Egyptian art Never before and never since has the quality of monumentality been achieved as fully as it was in Egypt The reason for this is not the external size and massiveness of their works although the Egyptians admittedly achieved some amazing things in this respect Many modern structures exceed those of Egypt in terms of purely physical size But massiveness has nothing to do with monumentality An Egyptian sculpture no bigger than a person s hand is more monumental than that gigantic pile of stones that constitutes the war memorial in Leipzig for instance Monumentality is not a matter of external weight but of inner weight This inner weight is the quality which Egyptian art possesses to such a degree that everything in it seems to be made of primeval stone like a mountain range even if it is only a few inches across or carved in wood Europe s first Homo sapiens lived primarily on large game particularly reindeer Even under ideal circumstances hunting these fast animals with spear or bow and arrow is an uncertain task The reindeer however had a weakness that mankind would mercilessly exploit it swam poorly While afloat it is uniquely vulnerable moving slowly with its antlers held high as it struggles to keep its nose above water At some point a Stone Age genius realized the enormous hunting advantage he would gain by being able to glide over the water s surface and built the first boat Once the easily overtaken and killed prey had been hauled aboard getting its body back to the tribal camp would have been far easier by boat than on land It would not have taken long for mankind to apply this advantage to other goods Industrial capitalism not only created work it also created leisure in the modern sense of the term This might seem surprising for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their machinery running as long as possible and forced their employees to work very long hours However by requiring continuous work during work hours and ruling out non work activity employers had separated out leisure from work Some did this quite explicitly by creating distinct holiday periods when factories were shut down because it was better to do this than have work interrupted by the casual taking of days off Leisure as a distinct non work time whether in the form of the holiday weekend or evening was a result of the disciplined and bounded work time created by capitalist production Workers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was enlarged by union campaigns which first started in the cotton industry and eventually new laws were passed that limited the hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements Leisure was also the creation of capitalism in another sense through the commercialization of leisure This no longer meant participation in traditional sports and pastimes Workers began to pay for leisure activities organized by capitalist enterprises Mass travel to spectator sports especially football and horse racing where people could be charged for entry was now possible The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated for whole new industries were emerging to exploit and develop the leisure market which was to become a huge source of consumer demand employment and profit Olivia and her sister Ellie were standing with Grandma in the middle of the cabbages Suddenly Grandma asked Do you know what a Cabbage White is Yes I learned about it in biology class It s a beautiful white butterfly Olivia answered Right But it lays its eggs on cabbages and then the caterpillars eat the cabbage leaves So why don t you help me to pick the caterpillars up Grandma suggested The two sisters gladly agreed and went back to the house to get ready Soon armed with a small bucket each Olivia and Ellie went back to Grandma When they saw the cabbage patch they suddenly remembered how vast it was There seemed to be a million cabbages Olivia stood open mouthed at the sight of the endless cabbage field She thought they could not possibly pick all of the caterpillars off Olivia sighed in despair Grandma smiled at her and said Don t worry We are only working on this first row here today Relieved she and Ellie started on the first cabbage The caterpillars wriggled as they were picked up while Cabbage Whites filled the air around them It was as if the butterflies were making fun of Olivia they seemed to be laughing at her suggesting that they would lay millions more eggs The cabbage patch looked like a battlefield Olivia felt like she was losing the battle but she fought on She kept filling her bucket with the caterpillars until the bottom disappeared Feeling exhausted and discouraged she asked Grandma Why don t we just get rid of all the butterflies so that there will be no more eggs or caterpillars Grandma smiled gently and said Why wrestle with Mother Nature The butterflies help us grow some other plants because they carry pollen from flower to flower Olivia realized she was right Grandma added that although she knew caterpillars did harm to cabbages she didn t wish to disturb the natural balance of the environment Olivia now saw the butterflies true beauty Olivia and Ellie looked at their full buckets and smiled Psychologists who study giving behavior have noticed that some people give substantial amounts to one or two charities while others give small amounts to many charities Those who donate to one or two charities seek evidence about what the charity is doing and if it is really having a positive impact If the evidence indicates that the charity is really helping others they make a substantial donation Those who give small amounts to many charities are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others psychologists call them warm glow givers Knowing that they are giving makes them feel good regardless of the impact of their donation In many cases the donation is so small or less that if they stopped to think they would realize that the cost of processing the donation is likely to exceed any benefit it brings to the charity Some prominent journalists say that archaeologists should work with treasure hunters because treasure hunters have accumulated valuable historical artifacts that can reveal much about the past But archaeologists are not asked to cooperate with tomb robbers who also have valuable historical artifacts The quest for profit and the search for knowledge cannot coexist in archaeology because of the time factor Rather incredibly one archaeologist employed by a treasure hunting firm said that as long as archaeologists are given six months to study shipwrecked artifacts before they are sold no historical knowledge is lost On the contrary archaeologists and assistants from the INA Institute of Nautical Archaeology needed more than a decade of year round conservation before they could even catalog all the finds from an eleventh century AD wreck they had excavated Then to interpret those finds they had to learn Russian Bulgarian and Romanian without which they would never have learned the true nature of the site Could a commercial archaeologist have waited more than a decade or so before selling the finds Scott Adams the creator of Dilbert one of the most successful comic strips of all time says that two personal letters dramatically changed his life One night he was watching a PBS TV program about cartooning when he decided to write to the host of the show Jack Cassady to ask for his advice about becoming a cartoonist Much to his surprise he heard back from Cassady within a few weeks in the form of a handwritten letter The letter advised Adams not to be discouraged if he received early rejections Adams got inspired and submitted some cartoons but he was quickly rejected Not following Cassady s advice he became discouraged put his materials away and decided to forget cartooning as a career About fifteen months later he was surprised to receive yet another letter from Cassady especially since he hadn t thanked him for his original advice He acted again on Cassady s encouragement but this time he stuck with it and obviously hit it big It was the first day of the new semester Steve and Dave were excited that they would be back at school again They rode their bicycles to school together that morning as they usually did Dave had math on the first floor and Steve was on the second with history On his way to the classroom Steve s teacher came up to him to ask if he wanted to run for student president Steve thought for a moment and answered Sure it ll be a great experience After class Steve spotted Dave in the hallway and ran to him excitedly I ve got good news I m going for student president and I think mine will be the only nomination Dave cleared his throat and replied with surprise Actually I ve just registered my name too He continued sharply Well best of luck But don t think you ll win the election Steve Dave walked quickly away and from that moment on there was an uncomfortable air of tension between the two friends Steve tried to be friendly toward Dave but he just didn t seem to care When the election day came Steve found that his bicycle had a flat tire so he started to run to school Just as he reached the end of the street Dave s dad who was driving Dave to school pulled over to give him a ride The dead silence in the car made the drive painful Noticing the bad atmosphere Dave s dad said You know only one of you can win You have known each other since birth Don t let this election ruin your friendship Try to be happy for each other His words hit Dave hard Looking at Steve Dave felt the need to apologize to him later that day Steve won the election Upon hearing the result Dave went over to Steve and congratulated him shaking his hand Steve could still see the disappointment burning in his eyes It wasn t until later that evening on the way home that Dave said apologetically I m so sorry Steve This election hasn t damaged our friendship has it Of course not Dave We re friends as always Steve responded with a smile As Steve arrived home his dad was proudly waiting for him and said Congratulations on the win How did Dave take it Steve replied We re fine now best friends for life His dad laughed Sounds like you won two battles today When people face real adversity disease unemployment or the disabilities of age affection from a pet takes on new meaning A pet s continuing affection becomes crucially important for those enduring hardship because it reassures them that their core essence has not been damaged Thus pets are important in the treatment of depressed or chronically ill patients In addition pets are used to great advantage with the institutionalized aged In such institutions it is difficult for the staff to retain optimism when all the patients are declining in health Children who visit cannot help but remember what their parents or grandparents once were and be depressed by their incapacities Animals however have no expectations about mental capacity They do not worship youth They have no memories about what the aged once were and greet them as if they were children An old man holding a puppy can relive a childhood moment with complete accuracy His joy and the animal s response are the same When teachers work in isolation they tend to see the world through one set of eyes their own The fact that there might be someone somewhere in the same building or district who may be more successful at teaching this or that subject or lesson is lost on teachers who close the door and work their way through the school calendar virtually alone In the absence of a process that allows them to benchmark those who do things better or at least differently teachers are left with that one perspective their own I taught various subjects under the social studies umbrella and had very little idea of how my peers who taught the same subject did what they did The idea of meeting regularly to compare notes plan common assessments and share what we did well never occurred to us Rather we spent much time in the social studies office complaining about a lack of time and playing the blame game Dr Paul Odland and his friend Bob travel frequently to South America where they provide free medical treatment for disabled children of poor families One day they went to a local marketplace Paul wanted to buy some souvenirs and he spotted a carving that he liked The non English speaking seller was asking pesos for the carving With Bob acting as interpreter Paul offered and his opponent proposed The bargaining in the noisy market became spirited even intense with Paul stepping up his price slightly and the seller going down slowly The pace increased so fast that Bob could not keep up with the back and forth interpretation Meanwhile observing the seller carefully Paul sensed something wrong in Bob s interpretation In fact the seller had gone below Paul s last offer When Paul raised his doubt Bob instantly recognized the error and corrected his interpretation At length they settled the deal and he was delighted to purchase the carving at a reasonable price and thanked Bob A seventeen year old German boy named Erik Brandes stepped out onto the empty vast stage of the Cologne Opera House It was the most exciting day of Erik s life The youngest concert promoter in Germany had persuaded the Opera House to host a late night concert of improvised jazz by the American pianist Keith Jarrett The concert was a sellout and later that evening Keith would sit down at the piano and play But when Erik introduced Keith and his producer Manfred to the piano on the stage that afternoon it didn t go well Keith and Manfred played a few notes Then after a long silence Manfred came to him and said Erik if you don t get another piano Keith can t play tonight Erik knew that Keith had requested a specific instrument which the Opera House had agreed to provide What he hadn t realized was that the administrative staff hadn t been able to find the requested B sendorfer piano and they had instead installed a tiny little B sendorfer that was in poor condition Understandably Keith didn t want to perform He left and went to wait in his car leaving Erik to anticipate the arrival of soon to be furious concert goers Desperate the German teenager caught up with Keith and begged the jazz pianist to play The pianist looked out at him standing in the rain completely soaked and took pity on him Never forget Keith said Only for you A few hours later Keith walked out to the unplayable piano in front of a packed concert hall When Keith began to play everybody immediately knew this was magic Erik too was deeply touched Keith was unexpectedly producing the performance of a lifetime despite the shortcomings of the piano His left hand produced thundering repetitive bass riffs as a way of covering up the piano s lack of resonance Keith really had to play that piano very hard to get enough volume to get to the balconies Standing up and sitting down Keith played the unplayable piano to produce something unique It wasn t the music that he ever imagined playing But faced with a challenge he accepted it and flew high The Greeks focus on the salient object and its attributes led to their failure to understand the fundamental nature of causality Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the air is due to the stone having the property of gravity But of course a piece of wood tossed into water floats instead of sinking This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due to the wood having the property of levity In both cases the focus is exclusively on the object with no attention paid to the possibility that some force outside the object might be relevant But the Chinese saw the world as consisting of continuously interacting substances so their attempts to understand it caused them to be oriented toward the complexities of the entire field that is the context or environment as a whole The notion that events always occur in a field of forces would have been completely intuitive to the Chinese The Atitl n Giant Grebe was a large flightless bird that had evolved from the much more widespread and smaller Pied billed Grebe By there were only around birds left on Lake Atitl n One immediate reason was easy enough to spot the local human population was cutting down the reed beds at a furious rate This destruction was driven by the needs of a fast growing mat making industry But there were other problems An American airline was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for fishermen However there was a major problem with this idea the lake lacked any suitable sporting fish To compensate for this rather obvious defect a specially selected species of fish called the Large mouthed Bass was introduced The introduced individuals immediately turned their attentions to the crabs and small fish that lived in the lake thus competing with the few remaining grebes for food There is also little doubt that they sometimes gobbled up the zebra striped Atitl n Giant Grebe s chicks The dancers stood on a two step elevated stage so that there was a natural gap between those who came to dance and those who came to watch The host randomly pulled the name of a well known dancer Linx out of a hat People cheered According to the format Linx had to call out another dancer to battle him on stage Instead of deliberately choosing someone however he decided to select his opponent randomly by making himself into a human spin wheel He propelled himself into a backspin covered his eyes and extended his arm above his head When his body finally stopped spinning his arm pointed away from the dancers on stage and directly at Dan Tres standing among the spectators The crowd erupted in Ohhhhs because he was an older family man who had not danced hip hop in many years while the much younger Linx was a nimble b boy Linx looked embarrassed but nonetheless he called out the respected elder to battle The midday sun was glorious The high school grounds were filled with well dressed people posing in fancy dresses and suits for cheerful photographers Congratulations hugs and laughter were contagious Hannah looked at all the familiar faces that had been part of her life for the last few years Soon her mother would be joining them She recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that same place in the middle of many anxious freshmen some of whom had become her closest friends That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead Hannah was nervous and trembling The principal was energetically addressing them talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life but she could not concentrate Later a tall strict looking man introduced himself as her homeroom teacher The classroom was old but neat and inviting Hannah was seated in the fifth row hallway side even though she had wanted a window seat High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted Hannah struggled with the many class hours the endless assignments and the exams However there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals How could she ever forget her second year She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival part of a sensational performance After that she had become more confident and active Her thoughts wandering Hannah vaguely heard her mother s voice Here you are Her mother hurried over and gave her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug Hannah you look so serious What are you thinking about Oh Mom just you know Her mother smiled You ll miss this place won t you Hannah nodded Quick her mother said stand over there and smile Hannah You have such a pretty smile She hurried out her cell phone zoomed in on her daughter and realized suddenly that she was looking at a young lady You re all grown up she whispered Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was rapidly expanding mistakes were made and these were costly both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industry s image High density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious diseases that in some cases devastated not just the caged fish but local wild fish populations too The negative impact on local wildlife inhabiting areas close to the fish farms continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the industry Furthermore a general lack of knowledge and insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially constructed meaning that pollution from excess feed and fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts These were costly lessons to learn but now stricter regulations are in place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites where there is good water flow to remove fish waste This in addition to other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten food has helped aquaculture to clean up its act Nancy was struggling to see the positive when her teen daughter was experiencing a negative perspective on her life and abilities In her desire to parent intentionally she went into her daughter s room and noted one positive accomplishment she had observed I know you ve been having a hard time lately and you aren t feeling really good or positive about your life But you did a great job cleaning up your room today and I know that must have been a big effort for you The next day to Nancy s surprise the teen girl seemed somewhat cheerful In passing she said Mom thanks for saying the positive thing about me yesterday I was feeling so down and couldn t think of anything good about myself After you said that positive thing it helped me see one good quality in myself and I ve been holding onto those words While the eye sees at the surface the ear tends to penetrate below the surface Joachim Ernst Berendt points out that the ear is the only sense that fuses an ability to measure with an ability to judge We can discern different colors but we can give a precise number to different sounds Our eyes do not let us perceive with this kind of precision An unmusical person can recognize an octave and perhaps once instructed a quality of tone that is a C or an F sharp Berendt points out that there are few acoustical illusions something sounding like something that in fact it is not while there are many optical illusions The ears do not lie The sense of hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible underlying order of things Through our ears we gain access to vibration which underlies everything around us The sense of tone and music in another s voice gives us an enormous amount of information about that person about her stance toward life about her intentions In my office I have a framed letter from a couple of children I have never met The letter holds a special significance for me It reads Dear Dr Brown thanks for teaching Mr Wills to teach Tisha and Kelly Mr Wills is Jeremy Wills and he is one of my former students A few years back he took my positive psychology class in college After graduation Jeremy joined an organization that recruits future leaders to teach in low income communities He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county in North Carolina Later his assistant principal took note of Jeremy s high expectations and asked him to take over his math class He took charge of about a dozen failing special ed kids and Tisha and Kelly were among them His idealism ran high and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems Before long the reality hit Jeremy hard Even after spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans it became clear that his methods were not working One of the worst moments was when he distributed a math test Many students didn t even look at the exam They just put their heads on their desks and slept Jeremy became so stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom Jeremy knew something had to change He then thought back to my class remembering how negative emotions can drag you down leaving positive emotions unnoticed That s when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students As the students attitudes became more optimistic their confidence with math grew too At the end of the school year percent of Jeremy s students passed the state s math test B B A friend of mine was sitting in the Miami airport reading a magazine while she waited to catch a plane to New York Her attention was distracted by a rough noisy quarrel taking place at the ticket counter But I must get to New York today an angry lady hotly told the clerk I m sorry ma am but there are no more seats available came the reply But my eight year old daughter is on that plane I can t let her fly into New York City all by herself she cried Sorry lady The flight is full came the same answer My friend had been watching and listening to the woman s woeful story and her heart was touched with compassion for the distressed mother She walked over to the ticket agent and offered to take a later flight if it meant the woman could use her ticket to travel to New York with her daughter The agent welcomed my friend s solution and quickly issued a revalidated ticket to the woman and then arranged for another flight for my friend B Oxygen is what it is all about Ironically the stuff that gives us life eventually kills it The ultimate life force lies in tiny cellular factories of energy called mitochondria that burn nearly all the oxygen we breathe in But breathing has a price The combustion of oxygen that keeps us alive and active sending out by products called oxygen free radicals They have Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde characteristics On the one hand they help guarantee our survival For example when the body mobilizes to fight off infectious agents it generates a burst of free radicals to destroy the invaders very efficiently On the other hand free radicals move uncontrollably through the body attacking cells rusting their proteins piercing their membranes and corrupting their genetic code until the cells become dysfunctional and sometimes give up and die These fierce radicals built into life as both protectors and avengers are potent agents of aging B When people started to plant stored seed stock deliberately they also began protecting their plants This changed the evolutionary pressure that these food plants experienced as they no longer had to survive in a natural environment Instead people created a new environment for them and selected for other characteristics than nature previously had Seeds recovered at archaeological sites clearly show that farmers selected for larger seeds and thinner seed coats Thick seed coats are often essential for seeds to survive in a natural environment because the seeds of many wild plants remain dormant for months until winter is over and rain sets in But under human management thick seed coats are unnecessary as farmers evade responsibility for storing seeds away from moisture and predators In fact seeds with thinner coats were preferred as they are easier to eat or process into flour and they allow seedlings to sprout more quickly when sown B How much space do you need to be happy Part of the American story is that bigger is better and with cheap credit and tax breaks for home buyers it s tempting to stretch one s finances to build or buy a larger house My grandpa Otto chose a different path He didn t want to find himself working longer and longer hours just to pay for more space and the stuff to fill it He grew up in a farming community and within a very large family so living simply was integral to his life philosophy In the s when my dad was a little boy my grandpa built a square foot cottage He put the twenty bythirty foot structure on a small plot of land in Pleasant Hill Dad remarked Reusing and recycling was a necessity In essence he was recycling before it became cool Grandpa got most of the materials for his little house from the Oakland docks where he was working It took four years to build the small cottage and when they moved in the roof wasn t even on My dad recalled looking up at the stars in the roofless house as a twelve year old kid before falling asleep Dad didn t mind living in an unfinished house He described Pleasant Hill as open and private It felt like all the homes were on ten acres Over the years my dad and grandpa noticed dramatic changes in their community Each year more farmland was devoured to build strip malls and neighborhoods with larger homes As real estate prices rose many of their neighbors sold their homes and lots Soon my grandpa had the only small house on the block surrounded by a sea of homes four times the size of his dwelling Yet my grandpa loved his little home and was content with what he had Even though the house was small it didn t feel cramped As my dad said Everyone was happy and content The size of the house didn t matter My grandpa taught me that living a simple life isn t about self deprivation Instead it s about giving yourself the time freedom and money to pursue your dreams In many ways I ve modeled my life after that of my grandpa I learned from him that simplicity isn t about austerity It s a revolution in personal growth A A I hope you remember our discussion last Monday about the servicing of the washing machine supplied to us three months ago I regret to say the machine is no longer working As we agreed during the meeting please send a service engineer as soon as possible to repair it The product warranty says that you provide spare parts and materials for free but charge for the engineer s labor This sounds unfair I believe the machine s failure is caused by a manufacturing defect Initially it made a lot of noise and later it stopped to operate entirely As it is wholly the company s responsibility to correct the defect I hope you will not make us pay for the labor component of its repair A As we all know it is not always easy to get work done at the office There is rarely quiet time during regular business hours to sit and concentrate Office workers are regularly interrupted by ringing phones impromptu meetings and chattering coworkers This can be as frustrating for an employee as it is for the employer who is paying for this nonproductive work time Working at home can free you from these distractions giving you long blocks of time to focus on your work Although your home may present its own problems too there are ways to deal with them Your productivity will certainly increase as will the quality of your work product At the same time you will get to enjoy the personal satisfaction of focusing on your work and getting it done A Mom once said that my grandmother came to America as a poor uneducated Greek immigrant at eighteen My grandmother wanted to go to school but the harsh immigrant life pushed her to support her family Though she never learned to read in school she knew many traditional stories from her home country My grandmother liked to tell me these interesting stories at night I still remember a few stories in which the gods made promises with each other like humans Those who broke their promises were punished While listening to the stories I decided that I would not break any promises The morals of her stories taught me how I should live my life One day when I saw my grandmother on the street by chance I noticed that she had difficulty in reading an English sign Right at that moment it hit upon me to teach her to read English in return for all she had taught me I talked to my mom about it and she was delighted with my plan So my grandmother and I worked hard together using books for beginners My efforts were rewarded only a month later on the morning of my eighteenth birthday My grandmother decorated a cake with HAPPY BIRTHDAY BETTY I had only taught her the basics of reading but she had written these words all by herself Touched by this simple message I said It s not just my birthday Grandma You stepped into this country at eighteen Now you are stepping into another new world So it s your birthday too Ellen Langer learned from her mother how to prepare a roast As a little girl she would watch as her mother cut off a small bit from one end of the meat before placing it in the roasting pan As an adult she followed the same routine However a question occurred to her one day Why did she have to cut off the end of the roast She asked her mother who just said she d learned to do it from her own mother Then Langer asked her grandmother She explained that when she was a young mother the only roasting pan she d had was too short for a standard roast so she had to cut off the end to fit it into the pan She d long since gotten roasting pans in larger sizes and hadn t cut an end off since Yet for years both Langer and her mother had mindlessly followed this routine In many countries amongst younger people the habit of reading newspapers has been on the decline and some of the dollars previously spent on newspaper advertising have migrated to the Internet Of course some of this decline in newspaper reading has been due to the fact that we are doing more of our newspaper reading online We can read the news of the day or the latest on business entertainment or however news on the websites of the New York Times the Guardian or almost any other major newspaper in the world Increasingly we can access these stories wirelessly by mobile devices as well as our computers Advertising dollars have simply been following the migration trail across to these new technologies We take it for granted that film directors are in the game of recycling Adapting novels is one of the most respectable of movie projects while a book that calls itself the novelization of a film is considered barbarous Being a hybrid art as well as a late one film has always been in a dialogue with other narrative genres Movies were first seen as an exceptionally potent kind of illusionist theatre the rectangle of the screen corresponding to the proscenium of a stage which appear actors Starting in the early silent period plays were regularly turned into films But filming plays did not encourage the evolution of what truly was distinctive about a movie the intervention of the camera its mobility of vision As a source of plot character and dialogue the novel seemed more suitable Many early successes of cinema were adaptations of popular novels Researchers have suggested that maintaining good social relations depends on two complementary processes being sensitive to the needs of others and being motivated to make amends or pay compensation when a violation does occur In short maintaining good social relations depends on the capacity for guilt Martin L Hoffman who has focused on the guilt that comes from harming others suggests that the motivational basis for this guilt is empathetic distress Empathetic distress occurs when people deny that their actions have caused harm or pain to another person Motivated by feelings of guilt they are inclined to make amends for their actions Making amends serves to repair damaged social relations and restore group harmony Anxiety has a damaging effect on mental performance of all kinds It is in one sense a useful response gone awry an overly zealous mental preparation for an anticipated threat But such mental rehearsal is disastrous cognitive static when it becomes trapped in a stale routine that captures attention intruding on all other attempts to focus elsewhere Anxiety undermines the intellect In a complex intellectually demanding and high pressure task such as that of air traffic controllers for example having chronically high anxiety is an almost sure predictor that a person will eventually fail in training or in the field The anxious are more likely to fail even given superior scores on intelligence tests as a study of students in training for air traffic control posts discovered Anxiety also sabotages academic performance of all kinds different studies of more than people found that the more prone to anxieties a person is the poorer his or her academic performance is On May th there was a heavy rain but the sun came out the next day Driving back from the village I stopped the car because a small woodchuck was traveling along the road its belly almost flat to the gravel I got out took off my sweater threw it over the woodchuck and wrapped him in it then put him on the floor of the car while I drove home I guessed the rain had washed out his burrow If I hadn t come along a he would have eventually died of starvation Rescuing him I felt as large as Fate At home I put him in the bathtub and my husband found a large carton c He put cat litter in the bottom and straw on top of that When I put the chuck in he gratefully burrowed into the straw I made a mixture of milk and baby cereal for him When I gave it to the chuck he ate it greedily d He accepted me quickly If I put my hand in the carton he nibbled my fingers It became clear that I was imprinting the woodchuck and vice versa Very shortly the carton seemed too small I offered him a nest made of a covered box bedded with straw and with a round doorway cut in the front He knew instantly that a hole spells home and b he dashed inside Every time I came to feed him he jumped into my lap as eagerly as ever As the months passed the chuck grew bigger and bigger My husband remarked that if I didn t do something soon I would be chased around for the rest of my days by a pound woodchuck begging for milk I decided to put him in a new burrow I found a hole along the wall of our orchard put the chuck near it and left him I continued to visit him with his milk Each time e he greeted me joyfully drank greedily and tried persistently to follow me back into the house The parting came unexpectedly I went away on a brief trip When I came back I saw no sign of him In the spring when I see a large handsome woodchuck playing on the grass I will hope that it is he One day in February Stephanie called Betty her best friend who was the only employee of her business Best Wedding Once again they discussed the company s expenses and dwindling revenue But this time Stephanie knew what she had to do She gathered up her courage and told her friend and colleague I have to make this work I have to let you go Betty was hurt but wasn t particularly surprised In a businesslike fashion the two women began figuring out how to disengage Betty said she wanted to start her own event planning business and Stephanie agreed to let her keep her existing clients some photography and documents and forms they had developed together She also gave Betty two months salary as severance pay On January a ship traveling through rough seas lost cargo containers one of which held floating bath toys Brightly colored ducks frogs and turtles were set adrift in the middle of the Pacific Ocean After seven months the first toys made landfall on beaches near Sitka Alaska kilometers from where they were lost Other toys floated north and west along the Alaskan coast and across the Bering Sea Some toy animals stayed at sea even longer They floated completely along the North Pacific currents ending up back in Sitka Researchers studied two mobile phone companies trying to solve a technological problem One company developed what it called a technology shelf created by a small group of engineers on which was placed possible technical solutions that other teams might use in the future It also created an open ended conversation among its engineers in which salespeople and designers were often included The boundaries among business units were deliberately ambiguous because more than technical information was needed to get a feeling for the problem However the other company proceeded with more seeming clarity and discipline dividing the problem into its parts Different departments protected their territory Individuals and teams competing with each other stopped sharing information The two companies did eventually solve the technological problem but the latter company had more difficulty than the former Until the s there were only three competitive swimming strokes freestyle backstroke and breaststroke and each had specific rules that described how it was to be performed The rules of breaststroke stated that both arms must be pulled together underwater and then recovered simultaneously back to the start of the pulling position to begin the next stroke Most people interpreted this arm recovery to mean an underwater recovery In the s however someone challenged the rules and reinterpreted this arm recovery to be an out of the water recovery Since this new breaststroke was about slower people using the conventional version couldn t effectively compete Something had to be done to solve the problem Finally this new stroke now known as the butterfly won recognition as the fourth swimming stroke and became an Olympic event in Even those of us who claim not to be materialistic can t help but form attachments to certain clothes Like fragments from old songs clothes can evoke both cherished and painful memories A worn thin dress may hang in the back of a closet even though it hasn t been worn in years because the faint scent of pine that lingers on it is all that remains of someone s sixteenth summer An impractical white scarf might be pulled out of a donation bag at the last minute because of the promise of elegance it once held for its owner And a ripped T shirt might be rescued from the dust rag bin long after the name of the rock band once written across it has faded Clothes document personal history for us the same way that fossils chart time for archaeologists When I was a freshman in high school I won second prize in our local newspaper s essay contest on the theme of future career I wrote about wanting to become a journalist We had to collect our prizes at the local variety store and while waiting in line a little notebook in the stationery department caught my eye It was a black and red hardcover book with the word Record neatly engraved in gold on the cover I reasoned that since I was going to be a journalist I d need a very special notebook in which to write So I bought it But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about it and about becoming a journalist Painting became my great love Upon graduating from high school I went to college as a fine art major and English minor After becoming a professional artist marriage followed then the birth of two daughters A career change came next which led to teaching underprivileged young children in Los Angeles The years passed Then during a serious illness when I was thirty five I found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years earlier From my sick bed I noticed it on a nearby shelf It was still blank but something told me to write my deepest feelings and thoughts my pain and fear my wishes and dreams the words of my inner world This was my first official journal And the process of journal keeping through writing and drawing helped heal me from a mysterious illness which had defied the doctors and their medicines My life changed so much after that I began listening to my own feelings and inner wisdom The insights I gained through journal keeping led me into a new career as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing More importantly I learned to play and enjoy life again For instance several years after recovering from my illness I started skateboarding for the first time in my life and loved it I m grateful to that high school girl that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank book I used it to save my life and to help others Kate and Joan who had not seen each other for three months were chatting happily in Joan s apartment After a short conversation Joan went to prepare coffee Soon she came back with the cups and saucers and put them down on a small side table While Joan was looking for a tablecloth Kate was wandering around the room looking at the pictures on the walls Intent on one of the pictures she took a step back and hit the small table tipping it over All the cups and saucers were broken Kate felt guilty for her negligence As she helped Joan clean up she tried to think of a way to compensate her for the damage Later Joan mentioned that she was looking for volunteers to work in a fair she was organizing Although Kate had something important to do on that particular Sunday she decided to cancel her plans and volunteer to help Joan The word courage takes on added meaning if you keep in mind that it is derived from the Latin word cor meaning heart The dictionary defines courage as a quality which enables one to pursue a right course of action through which one may provoke disapproval hostility or contempt Over years ago La Rochefoucauld went a step further when he said Perfect courage is to do unwitnessed what we should be capable of doing before all men It is not easy to show moral courage in the face of either indifference or opposition But persons who are daring in taking a wholehearted stand for truth often achieving results that surpass their expectations On the other hand halfhearted individuals are seldom distinguished for courage even when it involves their own welfare To be courageous under all circumstances requires strong determination We anticipate the future as if we found it too slow in coming and we were trying to hurry it up So imprudent are we that we wander about in times that are not ours and do not think of the one that belongs to us We try to support the present with the future and think of arranging things we cannot control for a time we have no certainty of reaching Examine your thoughts and you will find them wholly occupied with the past or the future We almost never think of the present and if we do so it is only to shed light on our plans for the future The past and the present are our means only the future is our end Contrary to what we usually believe the best moments in our lives are not the passive receptive relaxing times although such experiences can also be enjoyable if we have worked hard to attain them The best moments usually occur when a person s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen For a child it could be placing with trembling fingers the last block on a tower she has built higher than any she has built so far for a sprinter it could be trying to beat his own record for a violinist mastering an intricate musical passage For each person there are thousands of opportunities challenges to expand ourselves Many people take numerous photos while traveling or on vacation or during significant life celebrations to preserve the experience for the future But the role of photographer may actually detract from their delight in the present moment I know a father who devoted himself earnestly to photographing the birth of his first and only child The photos were beautiful but he lamented afterward he felt that he had missed out on the most important first moment of his son s life Looking through the camera lens made him detached from the scene He was just an observer not an experiencer Teach yourself to use your camera in a way that neglects your ongoing experiences by truly looking at things and noticing what is beautiful and meaningful After several futile attempts to teach the role of theme or the prominent repeated melody in classical music the teacher was at wit s end Having reminded her students many times that composers like Wagner depended on the listeners remembering the earlier theme to recognize its later use she was determined to make her students understand that themes recur throughout a piece She knew that her class had little trouble with simple variations and could easily identify themes that were repeated in a similar way But when the theme showed much variation the students attention focused on the new detail to such an extent that they no longer heard the basic theme For a week or two the teacher worried about the problem Other teachers advised her to go on with something else but she continued to search for a solution With this problem in mind one afternoon during the lunch hour she noticed a group of students gathered in a corner of the school yard Several girls were moving their bodies rhythmically Curious she drew closer and found that the students were listening to a new rock hit A girl in the center of the group held a tape recorder in her hand At that moment a sudden inspiration took hold The following day in class she asked how many students had tape recorders A dozen or so students said I do The teacher said excitedly I have an idea Let s play Beethoven s Eroica again One of you can record the theme when it s first introduced Then later someone else can record it the second time it appears Finally we ll have another person record when it appears next Then we can start all three tape recorders at exactly the same time to see if the recordings fit Her students looked at her in surprise Suddenly however delight appeared on their faces And so it was done When they played the recordings simultaneously the sounds blended sufficiently for the students to recognize their commonality It was a beautiful Friday afternoon and the weekend was about to begin but Rob had a lot on his mind He had been putting off doing his chemistry report which was due on Monday After borrowing some books from the library he went home Later that evening he was doing the assignment when his father came in What are you doing kid he asked Biography of Marie Curie Rob said absently as he was typing on his computer Really I did that for a chemistry assignment when I was in school his father said Why don t you find some information from the encyclopedia over there he added Rob grabbed the encyclopedia He smiled thinking that even though he was practically born playing computer games he was still doing the same assignments his father did over years ago While awaiting the birth of a new baby North American parents typically furnish a room as the infant s sleeping quarters For decades child rearing advice from experts has encouraged the nighttime separation of baby from parent For example a study recommends that babies be moved into their own room by three months of age By six months a child who regularly sleeps in her parents room is likely to become dependent on this arrangement reports the study Yet parent infant co sleeping is the norm for approximately percent of the world s population Cultures as diverse as the Japanese the Guatemalan Maya and the Inuit of Northwestern Canada practice it While manned space missions are more costly than unmanned ones they are more successful Robots and astronauts use much of the same equipment in space But a human is much more capable of operating those instruments correctly and to place them in appropriate and useful positions Rarely is a computer more sensitive and accurate than a human in managing the same geographical or environmental factors Robots are also not equipped with capabilities like humans to solve problems as they arise and they often collect data that are unhelpful or irrelevant Figures A and B demonstrate how dew point is measured by a dew point hygrometer In Figure A light is transmitted from a laser and reflected off the mirror onto a receiver that measures the intensity of the observed light When the mirror temperature is above dew point and the intensity of the transmitted light is mW cm the intensity of the observed light is the same In Figure B when the mirror temperature is at dew point dew drops cover the surface of the mirror When the transmitted light hits the dew drops it becomes scattered As a consequence compared to the intensity of the transmitted light that of the observed light measured by the receiver is increased Responses to survey questions are influenced by events and we should consider this when reviewing the results of a survey The reputation of an airline for example will be damaged if a survey is conducted just after a plane crash A computer company lost its reputation in company surveys just after major news coverage about a defect in its products On the positive side surveys by a beverage company about its image showed very favorable public attitudes just after its massive investment in the Olympics Consequently surveys should be conducted when the organization is not in the news or connected to a significant event that may influence public opinion In neutral context a more valid survey can be conducted about an organization s reputation products or services War seems to be part of the history of humanity Countries regions and even villages were economically independent of one another in the past Under those circumstances the destruction of our enemy might have been a victory for us There was a relevance to violence and war However today we are so interdependent that the concept of war has become outdated When we face problems or disagreements today we have to arrive at solutions through dialog We must work to resolve conflicts in a spirit of reconciliation and always keep in mind the interests of others We cannot destroy our neighbors We cannot ignore their interests Doing so would ultimately cause us to suffer Therefore the concept of violence is now unsuitable and nonviolence is the appropriate method Flying over rural Kansas in an airplane one fall evening was a delightful experience for passenger Walt Morris He watched the twinkling farmhouse lights below Suddenly the peace of the evening was broken when the plane s landing lights started flashing on and off What s happening he wondered as he gripped the armrests As the pilot was about to make an announcement he thought This is it He s going to tell us we ve got a major problem Instead he told the passengers In case you re worried about the flashing lights outside the plane I m sending a signal to my kids He was relieved to hear the continued announcement They re at home over on that hill to the left and they just sent me a Morse code message saying Good night Dad Many social scientists have believed for some time that birth order directly affects both personality and achievement in adult life In fact people have been using birth order to account for personality factors such as an aggressive behavior or a passive temperament One might say Oh I m the eldest of three sisters so I can t help that I m so overbearing or I m not very successful in business because I m the youngest child and thus less aggressive than my older brothers and sisters Recent studies however have proved this belief to be false In other words birth order may define your role within a family but as you mature into adulthood accepting other social roles birth order becomes insignificant You may think that moving a short distance is so easy that you can do it in no time with little effort You may decide to use your own car because you think that you don t need the services of a moving company Well you might be wrong You are under the false impression that you do not have as many items to pack as you really do You find out too late that your car cannot carry as much as you thought it could So it takes you far more trips to your new home than you thought it would There is also the possibility of damage your stuff some of it valuable All these things considered it might be better to ask for the services of a moving company The first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the s but the French were slow to employ the new technology There were several reasons for this hesitancy Radio absorbed the majority of state resources and the French government was reluctant to shoulder the financial burden of developing national networks for television broadcasting Television programming costs were too high and program output correspondingly low Poor distribution combined with minimal offerings provided little incentive to purchase the new product Further television sets were priced beyond the means of a general public whose modest living standards especially in the s and s did not allow the acquisition of luxury goods Ideological influences also factored in elites in particular were skeptical of television perceiving it as a messenger of mass culture and Americanization A violin creates tension in its strings and gives each of them an equilibrium shape a straight line A tight violin string can be viewed as composed of many individual pieces that are connected in a chain as in the above two figures When the string is straight as in Figure its tension is uniform and the two outward forces on a given piece sum to zero they have equal magnitudes and point in opposite directions With no net forces acting on its pieces the string is in equilibrium But when the string is curved as in Figure the outward forces on its pieces no longer sum to zero Although the string s uniform tension still gives those outward forces equal magnitudes they now point in slightly different directions and each piece experiences a zero net force The net forces on its pieces are restoring forces which will cause the string to vibrate and thus make sounds The first true piece of sports equipment that man invented was the ball In ancient Egypt pitching stones was children s favorite game but a badly thrown rock could hurt a child Egyptians were therefore looking for something less dangerous to throw And they developed what were probably the first balls They were first made of grass or leaves held together by strings and later of pieces of animal skin sewn together and stuffed with feathers or hay Even though the Egyptians were warlike they found time for peaceful games Before long they devised a number of ball games Perhaps they played ball more for instruction than for fun Ball playing was thought of mainly as a way to teach young men the speed and skill they would need for war The first thing I notice upon entering this garden is that the ankle high grass is greener than that on the other side of the fence Dozens of wildflowers of countless varieties cover the ground to both sides of the path Creeping plants cover the polished silver gate and the sound of bubbling water comes from somewhere The perfume of wildf lowers fills the air as the grass dances upon a gentle breeze A large basket of herbs rests against the fence to the west Every time I walk in this garden I think Now I know what it is like to live in paradise In general one s memories of any period necessarily weaken as one moves away from it One is constantly learning new facts and old ones have to drop out to make way for them At twenty I could have written the history of my school days with an accuracy which would be quite impossible now But it can also happen that one s memories grow much sharper even after a long passage of time This is because one is looking at the past with fresh eyes and can isolate and as it were notice facts which previously existed undifferentiated among a mass of others There are things what in a sense I remembered but which did not strike me as strange or interesting until quite recently There are few people who do not react to music to some degree The power of music is diverse and people respond in different ways To some it is mainly an instinctive exciting sound to which they dance or move their bodies Other people listen for its message or take an intellectual approach to its form and construction appreciating its formal patterns or originality Above all however there can be hardly anyone who is not moved by some kind of music Music covers the whole range of emotions It can make us feel happy or sad helpless or energetic and some music is capable of overtaking the mind until it forgets all else It works on the subconscious creating or enhancing mood and unlocking deep memories Object identification rarely occurs in isolation Face perception seems to work the same way Notice that when seen as part of a face presented in Figure A any bump or line will be sufficient to depict a feature However the result may be different when the features are separated from the context as shown in Figure B The features in Figure B are basically identical with those in Figure A but out of context they are less identifiable As in Figure C we actually require a more simplified presentation than in Figure B to identify facial features unambiguously when presented in isolation Thus our understanding of context compensates for lack of detail in the feature identification process There is a good reason to make this trip to the Island of Paradise Captain Koppe told himself as he stepped out of the elevator car into the covered rooftop hangar of his house The journey itself would be of use There were times when it was important to be alone to have time to think Alone even from one s personal robot from one s trusted wife Captain Koppe sensed that this was one of those times when he had to be alone if for no other reason than to remind himself that he would have to make his decision alone And he would have the duration of the flight all to himself The thought appealed to him as he powered up the aircar and it lifted a half meter or so off the deck of the hangar The outer doors opened and the aircar slowly eased out into the driving rain Suddenly it was in the middle of the storm jumping and swinging in the darkness the rain crashing down on the windows with incredible violence The storm boomed and roared outside the long range aircar as it fought for altitude the banging and clattering getting worse with every moment Smooth sailing after the storm the aircar arrived at the orbit of the Island of Paradise Captain Koppe looked out at the Island through the window He had been longing for it since his childhood At that moment his family picture posted on the inside of the aircar came into his eyes All of a sudden he had an irresistible urge to go to see his beloved wife and his two sons He turned his back on the Island of Paradise and directed it toward the homeland Not only does the leaf fish look like a leaf but it also imitates the movement of a drifting leaf underwater Its hunting technique is not to swiftly pursue its victim but to wait for it Hanging at an angle in the water the leaf fish is carried along by the currents until it comes near a smaller fish Then it seizes the unsuspecting prey with a lightning fast snap of the jaws and swallows the prey down head first At close range the rapid opening of the leaf fish s large jaws enables it to suck in the unfortunate individual very easily I was five years old when my father introduced me to motor sports Dad thought it was a normal family outing to go to a car racing event It was his way of spending some quality time with his wife and kids Little did he know that he was fueling his son with a passion that would last for a lifetime I still remember the awesome feeling I had on that day in May when my little feet carried me up the stairs into the grandstands at the car racing stadium To be a mathematician you don t need an expensive laboratory The typical equipment of a mathematician is a blackboard and chalk It is better to do mathematics on a blackboard than on a piece of paper because chalk is easier to erase and mathematical research is often filled with mistakes One more thing you need to do is to join a club devotes to mathematics Not many mathematicians can work alone they need to talk about what they are doing If you want to be a mathematician you had better expose your new ideas to the criticism of others It is so easy to include hidden assumptions that you do not see but that are obvious to others Although most people recognize it as a jewel the diamond most directly affects our daily lives as a tool Industrial diamonds are so important that a shortage would cause a breakdown in the metal working industry and would destroy mass production Industrial diamonds are crushed and powdered and then used in many grinding and polishing operations Their use ranges from the drill in a dentist s office to saws for cutting rocks and to glass cutters The great hardness of a diamond makes it one of the most important industrial materials known The Nambawi is one of the oldest traditional winter hats in Korea At first only men and women of the upper classes wore it Later it was worn by the commoners and still later only by women The hat protects the head and forehead from freezing winds and has a round opening at the top There is a long back flap for the back of the neck and ear flaps on both sides reveal the ears Silk sashes are attached to the ear flaps The sashes are tied under the chin to hold the hat tightly in place The bottom of the Nambawi is bordered with fur and the hat is decorated with flower and bird patterns Margo was on holiday with friends three miles off the Kenyan coast in the Indian Ocean in a fishing boat Suddenly the engine died and for mysterious reasons the boat began to sink Before they knew what was happening Margo her three friends and the African boatman were in the sea They all had life jackets but it was a long way to shore Around them were lots of wooden barrels and boards At that moment one of the three friends said I don t know how to swim Margo took charge She shouted out orders She told each person to take a wooden board use it as a float and begin kicking slowly toward shore She ordered the non swimmer to share a piece of board with her Kick softly she told him Don t stir up the water more than you have to With Margo s firm presence next to him the non swimmer avoided panic When every now and then his kicking became awkward and noisy Margo ordered him to stop Slowly and quietly the five moved toward the distant shore They all reached the beach two hours later exhausted but safe At that time the non swimmer thanked Margo for saving his life and he asked why she had been so insistent about going slowly and quietly Because she said to him for one thing I knew it was a long way and we had to conserve our energy For another that ocean is full of sharks and I didn t care to attract their attention But if I d told you that you might have panicked and none of us would have made it Situated at an elevation of m the city of Kathmandu which looks out on the sparkling Himalayas enjoys a warm climate year round that makes living here pleasant Kathmandu sits almost in the middle of a basin forming a square about km north south and km east west It was the site of the ancient kingdom of Nepal It is now the capital of Nepal and as such the center of its government economy and culture Possibly the most effective way to focus on your goals is to write them down Although this may sound like an obvious f irst step it is a step that many people ignore As a result their goals of ten remain unfocused and therefore unrealized Go to a fairly quiet place where you are not likely to be disturbed Make a list of every goal you have Include goals about finances relationships and your career Be as specific as possible Falling in love is alike being wrapped in a magical cloud The air feels fresher the f lowers smell sweeter food tastes more delicious and the stars shine more brilliantly in the night sky You feel light and happy as though you are sailing through life Your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant Your body feels alive and you jump out of bed each morning with a smile on your face You are in a state of supreme delight Like all other industries the rose business must adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace In the past a florist shop was most likely a local independently owned business that bought roses from a wholesaler who purchased them from a farmer On special days like Valentine s Day the cost of a dozen roses rose twofold or more as a result of high demand Today suppliers of roses include large supermarket chains wholesalers who sell directly at many locations and direct telephone marketers The romance of roses has been replaced by economic realities I have been asked to assist in creating a committee to improve the Sunshine Charity We are trying to form a strong committee and I have been asked to request you to join it I know you will be interested in the objective of our committee We all know how invaluable your advice and help will be The first meeting will be held here at a m next Thursday I hope you will be able to come and that you will agree to sit on the committee The claim that we have recently entered the information age is misleading Flooded by cellphones the Internet and television we incorrectly imagine that our ancestors inhabited an innocent world where the news did not travel far beyond the village It may not be valid to assume that the media make our time distinct from the past because we know relatively little about how information was shared in the past In fact the Olympics celebrate the memory of the Greek soldier who brought the news of the Athenian victory over the Persians Most of us could come up with many other examples message drums smoke signals church bells ship flags But their primitiveness would only confirm our sense that we live in a fundamentally different world one of constant instant access to information All ages have had a means of sharing information What makes our time distinct is not the density of the data we take in It is the technology that does the transmitting Thanks to satellites we can find out instantly about events that occur on the other side of the world It usually took five weeks for Benj amin Franklin in Paris to receive a letter sent from Philadelphia But the news was still new and surprising to people there a group of similar things that one has deliberately acquired usually over a period of time Robert s collection of prints and p aintings has been bought over the y ears the act of asking for money from people to give to charity We need to take up a collection for the homeless stories poems or articles in one book Two years ago he p ublished a collection of short stories about children Recently a severe disease hit Asian nations hard causing several hundred deaths Many people who live in this part of the world are likely to be worried again with the beginning of the cold weather In spite of their close location to these countries however Korea has remained free of the deadly disease Many people think the secret is kimchi a traditional Korean dish served with almost every meal Mom was an extraordinarily clean person After feeding my brother and me breakfast she would scrub mop and dust everything As we grew older Mom made sure we did our part by keeping our rooms neat Outside she would tend a small flower garden which was the envy of the neighborhood With Mom everything she touched turned to gold She didn t believe in doing anything halfway She often told us that we always had to do our best in whatever we did Vicky who is wearing a heavy winter coat is practicing on her high school stage for tomorrow s presentation of a play The event is presented as part of a school program that celebrates the end of the school year and shows what the students have learned Sumi one of Vicky s close friends has dropped by to say hello Hi Vicky It s really cold in here How s it going with your play So far so good Vicky replies but I may be getting cold feet I m really nervous about tomorrow Sumi adds with a worried look Tomorrow will be much colder so be sure to wear heavy socks Our parents cast long shadows over our lives and we become aware of their existence when we are infants Parents first teach us essential ways of living by cautioning Don t touch or It s not nice to do that We may think that we learn these lessons through independent efforts but it s not the way we obtain them at all It is our parents who have given us our sense of right and wrong our understanding of love and our knowledge of who we are As we grow up we see them less and less We leave their homes and we start new families of our own So sometimes we think that we can walk in the sun free of the shadows But still the shadows have not gone We carry their being with us all our lives in the sounds of our voices the look and feel of our skin and the warmth of our hands and our hearts It is only when they are gone and we never see them that we find that they and we are indivisible In fact we have not been able to separate ourselves from them our whole lives long The shadows are still there but they have never really blocked the light at all An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to like things more and find them more appealing if everything about those things is not obvious the first time we experience them This is certainly true in music For example we might hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest and decide we like it Then the next time we hear it we hear a lyric we didn t catch the first time or we might notice what the piano or drums are doing in the background A special harmony emerges that we missed before We hear more and more and understand more and more with each listening Sometimes the longer that takes for a work of art to reveal all of its subtleties to us the more fond of that thing whether it s music art dance or architecture we become Sometimes the awareness that one is distrusted can provide the necessary incentive for self reflection An employee who realizes she isn t being trusted by her co workers with shared responsibilities at work might upon reflection identify areas where she has consistently let others down or failed to follow through on previous commitments Others distrust of her might then forbid her to perform her share of the duties in a way that makes her more worthy of their trust But distrust of one who is sincere in her efforts to be a trustworthy and dependable person can be disorienting and might cause her to doubt her own perceptions and to distrust herself Consider for instance a teenager whose parents are suspicious and distrustful when she goes out at night even if she has been forthright about her plans and is not breaking any agreed upon rules her identity as a respectable moral subject is undermined by a pervasive parental attitude that expects deceit and betrayal e Aristotle did not think that all human beings should be allowed to engage in political activity in his system women slaves and foreigners were explicitly excluded from the right to rule themselves and others Nevertheless his basic idea that politics is a unique collective activity that is directed at certain common goals and ends still resonates today But which ends Many thinkers and political figures since the ancient world have developed different ideas about the goals that politics can or should achieve This approach is known as political moralism For moralists political life is a branch of ethics or moral philosophy so it is unsurprising that there are many philosophers in the group of moralistic political thinkers Political moralists argue that politics should be directed toward achieving substantial goals or that political arrangements should be organized to protect certain things Among these things are political values such as justice equality liberty happiness fraternity or national self determination At its most radical moralism produces descriptions of ideal political societies known as Utopias named after English statesman and philosopher Thomas More s book Utopia published in which imagined an ideal nation Utopian political thinking dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato s book the Republic but it is still used by modern thinkers such as Robert Nozick to explore ideas Some theorists consider Utopian political thinking to be a e promising undertaking since it has led in the past to justifications of totalitarian violence However at its best Utopian thinking is part of a process of striving toward a better society and many thinkers use it to suggest values to be pursued or protected When Master Brooks played a Mozart piece on the violin for his class to learn the room was filled with waves of beautiful soul stirring sound The class tried to emulate the music played by this renowned guest musician Among the students in the class Joe Brooks was by far the best In fact Joe was the master s son His father had placed a baby violin in his hands at the age of four and Joe was a natural talent Now just twelve years later he was already on his way to becoming a virtuoso like his father After the class Joe was alone with his father He had something important to talk about Joe took a deep breath and said I have been asked to play in a concert and I would like your permission first It is a crossover concert Master Brooks looked surprised Indeed the master s dislike of crossover music was no secret Father Joe took a deep breath and continued I respect your views but it is not what you think Why don t you come and listen to our practice tomorrow If you don t like it I will cancel Well did you get permission asked Brian as soon as Joe entered the practice room the following day Um I m not sure answered Joe without confidence You can tell us about it after practice Brian said as he placed his fingers on the keyboard Beside him Nick was tuning his guitar Joe thought that he would play just one last time before telling them that he might pull out of the concert The trio swung into their routine as easily as only a group that had practiced long and hard together could When they finished practicing Joe noticed his father standing in the corner Wow that was quite wonderful he said with admiration Master Brooks came toward his son I love the way you created those unique sounds while keeping the spirit of the violin I underestimated the power that crossover music can create said Master Brooks to him Joe and his father returned home both humming the melody that the band had been practicing Humans are so averse to feeling that they re being cheated that they often respond in ways that seemingly make little sense Behavioral economists the economists who actually study what people do as opposed to the kind who simply assume the human mind works like a calculator have shown again and again that people reject unfair offers even if it costs them money to do so The typical experiment uses a task called the ultimatum game It s pretty straightforward One person in a pair is given some money say She then has the opportunity to offer some amount of it to her partner The partner only has two options He can take what s offered or refused to take anything There s no room for negotiation that s why it s called the ultimatum game What typically happens Many people offer an equal split to the partner leaving both individuals happy and willing to trust each other in the future Here s an interesting thought If glaciers started re forming they have a great deal more water now to draw on Hudson Bay the Great Lakes the hundreds of thousands of lakes of Canada none of which existed to fuel the last ice sheet so they would grow very much quicker And if they did start to advance again what exactly would we do Blast them with TNT or maybe nuclear missiles Well doubtless we would but consider this In the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America rocked Alaska with megatons of concentrated might the equivalent of nuclear bombs Almost miles away in Texas water sloshed out of swimming pools A street in Anchorage fell twenty feet The quake devastated square miles of wilderness much of it glaciated And what effect did all this might have on Alaska s glaciers None John was once in the office of a manager Michael when the phone rang Immediately Michael bellowed That disgusting phone never stops ringing He then proceeded to pick it up and engage in a fifteen minute conversation while John waited When he finally hung up he looked exhausted and frustrated He apologized as the phone rang once again He later confessed that he was having a great deal of trouble completing his tasks because of the volume of calls he was responding to At some point John asked him Have you ever considered having a certain period of time when you simply don t answer the phone Michael said As a matter of fact no looking at him with a puzzled look It turned out that this simple suggestion helped Michael not only to relax but to get more work done as well Like many people he didn t need hours of uninterrupted time but he did need some d By the turn of the twentieth century the permanent repertoire of musical classics dominated almost every field of concert music from piano song or chamber music recitals to operas and orchestral concerts The change from a century before was enormous In the eighteenth century performers and listeners demanded new music all the time and ancient music included anything written more than twenty years earlier But musicians and audiences in the early s expected that most concert music they performed or heard would be at least a generation old and they judged new music by the standards of the classics already enshrined in the repertoire In essence concert halls and opera houses had become museums for displaying the musical artworks of the past two hundred years The repertoire varied according to the performing medium and from region to region but the core was largely the same throughout most of Europe and the Americas including operas and operatic excerpts from Mozart through Verdi Wagner and Bizet orchestral and chamber music from Haydn through the late Romantics and keyboard music by J S Bach Haydn Mozart Beethoven and prominent nineteenth century composers Living composers increasingly found themselves in competition with the music of the past This is the great theme of modern music in the classical tradition especially in the first half of the century in competing with past composers for the attention of performers and listeners who d disregarded the classical masterworks living composers sought to secure a place for themselves by offering something new and distinctive while continuing the tradition They combined individuality and innovation with emulation of the past seeking to write music that would be considered original and worthy of performance alongside the masterworks of earlier times Princess a solid Boxer had been given to Rita when she was ten weeks old and Rita immediately bonded with a her petting her feeding her teaching her basic commands and letting her sleep on Rita s bed The two were always together and within arm s reach The only time they were apart was when Rita was learning to swim Princess had a fear of water that was so extreme that she couldn t even touch the water Princess fears stemmed from her puppyhood when c she almost drowned twice These early traumas made water the only thing that Princess truly feared When d she came close to a body of water she would try to pull back and seemed emotionally distressed Would she ever be able to overcome this fear She had a chance one late afternoon when Rita s mother took them to a shopping mall It was located along the edge of a lake and featured a wooden boardwalk which was built along the shore While her mother headed to a store Rita and Princess began to play on the boardwalk Suddenly a boy riding a bicycle slipped on the damp wooden surface hitting Rita at an angle which propelled her through an open section of the guard rail e She let out a scream of pain and fear as she fell into the water She then continued to cry for help and struggle to get out Upon hearing Rita s cry her mother rushed to the railing shouting for help from the entrance of the store a hundred feet or so away Princess was looking at the water and trembling in fear b She stood there staring at the water the one thing that had nearly taken her life Her love for Rita overpowered her fear and she leapt out through the same open space in the railing and plunged into the water Once in the water Princess quickly found Rita and slowly dragged her to the shore to her grateful mother Though most bees fill their days visiting flowers and collecting pollen some bees take advantage of the hard work of others These thieving bees sneak into the nest of an unsuspecting normal bee known as the host lay an egg near the pollen mass being gathered by the host bee for her own offspring and then sneak back out When the egg of the thief hatches it kills the host s offspring and then eats the pollen meant for its victim Sometimes called brood parasites these bees are also referred to as cuckoo bees because they are similar to cuckoo birds which lay an egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for that bird to raise They are more technically called cleptoparasites Clepto means thief in Greek and the term cleptoparasite refers specifically to an organism that lives off another by stealing its food In this case the cleptoparasite feeds on the host s hard earned pollen stores Some coaches erroneously believe that mental skills training MST can only help perfect the performance of highly skilled competitors As a result they shy away from MST rationalizing that because they are not coaching elite athletes mental skills training is less important It is true that mental skills become increasingly important at high levels of competition As athletes move up the competitive ladder they become more homogeneous in terms of physical skills In fact at high levels of competition all athletes have the physical skills to be successful Consequently any small difference in mental factors can play a huge role in determining performance outcomes However we can anticipate that personal growth and performance will progress faster in young developing athletes who are given mental skills training than in athletes not exposed to MST In fact the optimal time for introducing MST may be when athletes are first beginning their sport Introducing MST early in athletes careers may lay the foundation that will help them develop to their full potential Medicine became big business with the expansion of new higher cost treatments and the increased numbers of health care providers in the United States As more health care providers entered the market competition increased among them Interestingly the increase in competition led health care providers to recommend more services to the persons they served This phenomenon reflects a unique feature in the health care industry provider induced demand which allows health care providers to maintain their income even as competition increases Average consumers of health care do not know how to diagnose their medical conditions and do not have a license to order services or prescribe medications So consumers rely on the knowledge of health care providers to determine what services are needed even though they stand to make more money by ordering more services Andrew steadied his eyes upon the black and white squares He thought awhile before pushing his knight to an unbeatable position Now Andrew was sure he had beaten Timothy Tandon the winner of the National Chess Championship Andrew whom nobody had noticed before the tournament this year came to progress to the final match After enjoying this memorable victory Andrew headed straight to the nursing home where his sick grandad was staying When Andrew reached the nursing home Grandad was sitting up in bed You won the semi final he asked offering up a weak smile Andrew nodded his head Indeed Andrew s grandad was his chess master As a kid Andrew liked to observe Grandad play chess and often predicted his moves even before he began to move the pieces Andrew said Grandad inspired by his grandson s superb victory you are now all set to fulfill my dream Tomorrow you will surely win the National Chess Championship It was the day of the final match That morning Andrew had received a call from the nursing home informing him that Grandad s condition had become serious The news played upon Andrew s mind as he started to play After several fierce battles Andrew s concentration wavered for a moment His mind travelled to his grandad who was in another battle for his life It was then that Andrew made a big mistake The mistake was a fatal one and it was all over He had lost Andrew arrived at the nursing home in a gloomy mood but he was blessed with good news His grandad was recovering Andrew was greatly delighted but he could not help being disappointed in a corner of his mind I tried my best to fulfill your dream but I couldn t make it Andrew said in disappointment That s all right said Grandad The real lesson of chess is learning how to tame your mind See my mind has won the battle over my body I will recover soon and see you become champion one day in perfect health Andrew was relieved and smiled with joy If an animal is innately programmed for some type of behaviour then there are likely to be biological clues It is no accident that fish have bodies which are streamlined and smooth with fins and a powerful tail Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the water Similarly if you found a dead bird or mosquito you could guess by looking at its wings that flying was its normal mode of transport However we must not be over optimistic Biological clues are not essential The extent to which they are finding varies from animal to animal and from activity to activity For example it is impossible to guess from their bodies that birds make nests and sometimes animals behave in a way quite contrary to what might be expected from their physical form ghost spiders have tremendously long legs yet they weave webs out of very short threads To a human observer their legs seem a great hindrance as they spin and move about the web In researchers at Wayne State University asked a group of college volunteers to exercise for twenty minutes at a self selected pace on each of three machines a treadmill a stationary bike and a stair climber Measurements of heart rate oxygen consumption and perceived effort were taken throughout all three workouts The researchers expected to find that the subjects unconsciously targeted the same relative physiological intensity in each activity Perhaps they would automatically exercise at percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using Or maybe they would instinctively settle into rhythm at percent of their maximum rate of oxygen consumption in all three workouts But that s not what happened There was in fact no consistency in measurements of heart rate and oxygen consumption across the three disciplines Instead the subjects were found to have chosen the same level of perceived effort on the treadmill the bike and the stair climber In the summer of the actor Anthony Hopkins was signed to play a leading role in a film based on George Feifer s novel The Girl from Petrovka That is why he traveled to London to buy a copy of the book Unfortunately none of the main London bookstores had a copy Then on his way home waiting for an underground train at Leicester Square tube station he saw a discarded book lying on the seat next to him It was a copy of The Girl from Petrovka As if that was not coincidence enough more was to follow Later when he had a chance to meet the author Hopkins told him about this strange occurrence Feifer was interested He said to him that in November he had lent a friend a copy of the book a unique copy in which he had made notes on turning the British English into American English for the publication of an American version but his friend had lost the copy in London A quick check of the copy Hopkins had found showed that it was the very same copy that his friend had mislaid Richard was watching people on the street through the window Skirts were bouncing lightly and pants were dancing delightedly in the seasonable weather as the spring breeze chased them playfully Some seemed excited walking like racing cars between passersby He had ordered two black coffees one for himself and one for his friend Julie She was running late but the service was fast The hot coffees were promptly placed in front of him Looking at the coffees Richard remembered that Julie liked whipped cream on top of her hot coffee He was wondering if it was better to put the cream on now or wait till she arrived Since the cream is cold it ll cool down the coffee faster he reasoned Beep It was a text message from her I ll be there in minutes Please put some cream on my coffee He was startled because she seemed to know what he was thinking about Richard called over a waiter wearing a blue shirt and asked him for whipped cream Handing a spray can of cream over to Richard the waiter said Add it now if you want Richard couldn t help asking him why The blue shirted man answered Actually hotter coffee loses energy faster than coffee cooled slightly by the addition of cream Really Is that so The waiter kindly smiled and said Yeah I just learned it when I took a class about coffee He also taught his customer how to make shapes with the cream Richard paid close attention to his explanation Richard thanked the waiter Following his instructions Richard made a flower with the cream He tried to be as precise as he could No sooner had he completed his masterpiece Julie stepped into the cafe As she sat down she saw her coffee Wow look at that A white flower in the cup It looks so beautiful Richard It s too lovely to drink his friend said Try it the happy man urged her She tasted it This coffee is absolutely delicious too Talking and laughing over coffee they enjoyed the fabulous spring day An independent artist is probably the one who lives closest to an unbounded creative situation Many artists have considerable freedom from external requirements about what to do how to do it when to do it and why At the same time however we know that artists usually limit themselves quite forcefully by choice of material and form of expression To make the choice to express a feeling by carving a specific form from a rock without the use of high technology or colors restricting the artist significantly Such choices are not made to limit creativity but rather to cultivate it When everything is possible creativity has no tension Creativity is strange in that it finds its way in any kind of situation no matter how restricted just as the same amount of water flows faster and stronger through a narrow strait than across the open sea The desert locust lives in two remarkably different styles depending on the availability of food sources and the density of the local locust population When food is scarce as it usually is in their native desert habitat locusts are born with coloring designed for camouflage and lead solitary lives But when rare periods of significant rain produce major vegetation growth everything changes At first the locusts continue to be loners just feasting off the abundant food supply But as the extra vegetation starts to die off the locusts find themselves crowded together Suddenly baby locusts are born with bright colors and a preference for company Instead of avoiding one another and hiding from predators through camouflage and inactivity these locusts gather in vast groups feed together and overwhelm their predators simply through numbers Ellie walked to school in her new shoes I like those Megan whispered Cool Ellie felt happy She knew it was hard to get compliments from Megan and couldn t hide her smile The two friends had desks side by side at the back Stop talking you two said Miss Smith Bring your books to me if you ve finished Ellie followed Megan to the front of the class She always let Megan go first She felt scared when Miss Smith was upset Miss Smith noticed her new shoes Those aren t suitable for school she said her voice cold Ellie took a deep breath The shop didn t have black shoes Miss Smith she said Her voice came out in a whisper The school uniform requires black or dark blue shoes said Miss Smith Report to me in proper shoes please On Monday She used her quiet shout voice and Ellie shivered In when the land was up for sale grandpa bought two hundred acres from the Granger family In he bought another two hundred It was good rich land However there were bank loans for and taxes on the land Unfortunately there had not been enough money from the cotton to pay both of them and live on To make things worse the price of cotton dropped in That was why papa had gone to work ending up in Louisiana in He set out looking for work first going far north and south and finally west into Louisiana It was there he found work laying track for the railroad He worked the remainder of the year away from us not returning until the deep winter The following spring after the planting was finished he did the same Now it was and papa was again in Louisiana laying track When he came back from Louisiana I asked papa why he had to go away and why the land was so important He took my hand and said in his quiet way Look out there Cassie All that belongs to you You will never have to live on other people s land As long as the family survives you will have your own place That s important You may not understand now but one day you will I looked at papa strangely for I knew that all the land did not belong to me Some of it belonged to Stacey Christopher and John not to mention the part that belonged to big mama and mama However papa never divided the land in his mind it was simply the land of our family For it he would work the long hot summer pounding steel mama would teach and run the farm and big mama in her sixties would work like a woman in her twenties in the cotton fields and keep the house but always the taxes would be paid Papa said that one day I would understand In the twentieth century advances in technology from refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation that carries fresh ingredients around the world contributed immeasurably to baking and pastry making At the beginning of the twenty first century the popularity of fine breads and pastries are growing even faster than new chefs can be trained Interestingly enough many of the technological advances in bread making have sparked a reaction among bakers and consumers alike They are looking to reclaim some of the flavors of old fashioned breads that were lost as baking became more industrialized and baked goods became more refined standardized and some would say flavorless Bakers are researching methods for producing the handmade sourdough breads of the past and they are experimenting with specialty flours in their search for flavor Although children watch television at various times the programming that they view alone tends to be specifically aimed at children In the United States particularly most of the advertising during this segment consists of ads for food particularly sugared food During the run up to Christmas increasing numbers of ads concern toys and games Such practices are believed to put pressure on parents to yield to what the media have dubbed pester power This has led to calls for legislation to promote advertising in Europe and the United States Indeed the Swedish government has outlawed television advertising of products aimed at children under and recently in the United States psychologists signed a petition calling for a ban on the advertising of children s goods Dave Butcher director of training for Sea World in Florida showed me more than I d imagined possible His sea lions worked for social rewards as well as fish Consequently he did not have to keep his sea lions hungry in order to make them perform During and after the day s performances the sea lions could have all the fish they wanted One result was that they were not irritable as any hungry animal might be The sea lions were friendly to those humans they knew and enjoyed being with them I was surprised to see trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their sea lions Another result of stopping food deprivation was that these sea lions grew and grew In fact they became bigger than most trained sea lions in the past which weren t given enough food It was my last football game as a college player I made the final tackle and we won As people chanted my name I was carried off the field on the shoulders of my teammates Although I wasn t a great student or a great football player I ended up not only graduating from my dream university but becoming a hero of the team People keep asking me how I did it Here is my story I was born into a large poor family in Chicago As a kid I had visions of being a hero a police officer or an astronaut However people would always tell me You can t do that You aren t smart enough You aren t strong enough Moreover I didn t do well in school and I had no hope of getting into any college After high school I gave up on my dream of going to college and got a part time job instead I felt like I was living in a box labeled This is where you belong It was so hard to break out of the box but I began to feel an urgent need for a change I signed up for the Army and went to the Vietnam War A lot of people were worried but I said Well I m going to get out of my box by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone else tell me what to do With that one crucial shift in thinking my whole attitude changed I began to dream of going to one of the best universities in the country and playing football After I finished my time in the Army I packed my bags and went to my dream university I knocked on the door of one of the professors offices and said Please tell me how to get in here The professor could see that I was determined He said I can t let you in the university but I will see you whenever you need my advice or help It took me a long time but I eventually got into that university became a football player and graduated B B Zaynab Fawwaz was born into a poor family in South Lebanon As a young girl she went to Alexandria with the Egyptian family for whom she worked Her mistress was intrigued by her maid s native intelligence and introduced Zaynab to her literate friend Fatima She in turn taught her reading writing and arithmetic Zaynab quickly learned what her teacher had to offer and in time went on to study with Egyptian scholars Eventually she became very active in women s issues and she wrote some pioneering poetry and essays focused on women s rights The most famous of her essays was The Zaynab Letters B Given that music appears to enhance physical and mental skills are there circumstances where music is damaging to performance One domain which this is of considerable significance is music s potentially damaging effects on the ability to drive safely Evidence suggests an association between loud fast music and reckless driving but how might music s ability to influence driving in this way be explained One possibility is that drivers adjust to temporal regularities in music and that their speed is influenced accordingly In other words just as faster music causes people to eat faster so it causes people to drive at faster speeds as they engage mentally and physically with ongoing repeated structures in the music B England s plan to establish colonies in North America starting in the late sixteenth century was founded on a false idea It was generally assumed that Virginia the region of the North American continent to which England laid claim would have the same climate as the Mediterranean region of Europe since it lay at similar latitudes As a result the English hoped that the American colonies once established would be able to supply Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England s dependence on imports from continental Europe One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide the wines fruit and salt of France and Spain the silks of Persia and Italy Similarly abundant timber would do away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia In short America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty that would quickly turn a profit A A When you have ideas you like you often think everyone else should feel the same way If they don t it very often becomes a matter of they just don t understand If a colleague around you doesn t understand your idea or its potential you are being given an important message Maybe your view of a problem that you think you are solving is not shared by other coworkers If your colleague cannot see it your consumers may not either Think about it Make constant efforts until everyone you explain your idea to understands it This is all to do with find simple solutions to our daily communication problems A

knew that the winner should be between him and Tony They were best friends but Zach considered him as his biggest competitor They both were great swimmers and had won an equal number of races To prepare for the race both Zach and Tony bought a specially made swimming suit that could minimize resistance against water and help them swim faster But they found out that this type of special suit had not been allowed in previous races Both Zach and Tony asked the swimming coach if they could wear it He said that he would let them know before the race Nothing was decided during the morning but shortly before the race the coach told Zach that he and Tony could wear the suit He asked Zach to tell Tony about it After hearing what his coach said Zach faced a difficult choice At first he hesitated to tell his friend about the news He thought that if he did not tell Tony about it he would definitely win the race On the other hand Zach s conscience whispered that a true victory comes from fair competition After a long conflict he finally decided to be honest He told Tony about the suit and they both joined the race wearing the suits Tony won the race and Zach congratulated him This was the sweetest second place Zach had ever won Henri Matisse came late to painting having trained to be a lawyer to please his father While he was in the hospital recovering from surgery his mother brought him a box of paints and a how to book and the world lost an attorney and gained an artist It was as if I had been called he remembered Henceforth I did not lead my life It led me Matisse left for Paris to study art with his father shouting Do you want me to see you starve He gained fame as leader of the Fauves show In Matisse began to spend winters in Vence where he donated a chapel of his own design that is one of the most moving religious buildings in Europe After local nuns nursed him through a serious illness in the s the grateful Matisse devoted himself to every detail of the chapel Deseada is a small island which belongs to the Lesser Antilles This island is said to have obtained its name from the desire Christopher Columbus felt of seeing land on his second voyage in It is twelve miles in length and six miles in width The part which looks to the north is lower than that which looks to the south The island abounds greatly in iguanas and in a species of birds called fragatas There is a deep cavern on the island containing the bones and arms of the Indians who it is supposed were buried there In this island was taken by the English who restored it the following year to the French by the Peace of Paris and since that time it has been in the possession of the latter If you ve ever gone snorkeling you may have seen an amazing sight an entire school of fish suddenly changes direction as one unit The same goes for flocks of birds So are they all following the commands of a leader Researchers have determined that there is no leader or controlling force Rather the individual fish or bird is reacting almost instantly to the movements of its neighbors in the school or flock Any individual can initiate a movement such as a change in direction and this sends out a maneuver wave which spreads through the group at an astounding speed Because individuals can see or sense the wave coming toward them they are ready to react more quickly than they would without such advance notice That appears to us as simultaneous is actually a kind of follow your neighbor behavior moving faster than the eye can see The growing season in the Arctic region is short as well as cool and plants must make the most of what warmth there is One adaptation by many arctic plants to the short growing season is wintergreen or semi evergreen leaves They are leaves that develop late in the summer and survive through winter without drying up and dying They remain green and can start photosynthesis as soon as the weather is warm enough in spring before there has been time for the new season s leaves to expand and start functioning They finally wither after the new leaves have taken over There are many common arctic plants with wintergreen leaves Among them are arctic poppy thrift alpine saxifrage and several kinds of chickweeds and starworts Wintergreen leaves are not limited to the Arctic many plants of the northern forests have them too Organic food production is growing by leaps and bounds Many consumers are willing to pay premium prices for organic foods convinced that they are helping the earth and eating healthier Some experts say however that organic farming has some drawbacks One of the most frequent criticisms is that the crop yields of organic farms are much lower than those of traditional farms That s because organic fields suffer more from weeds and insects than conventional fields Another argument often offered by experts is that organic farming can supply food for niche markets of wealthy consumers but cannot feed billions of hungry people around the globe Only the careful use of chemical inputs not the costly organic methods can help reduce food production significantly in the countries facing hunger The first memory I have of visiting a working artist s studio is a trip my family took to the studio of Grey Stone a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole family has cherished for many years When I was about five years old our family drove down to his studio with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery from the family collection We wanted Grey to make a set that would draw together the pieces we had collected over the years Even at that young age looking around Grey s house and studio complex I thought about how great it was that he could work at home withhis family around him and produce things with his own hands After accepting our request he immediately started working on one of the pieces Taking a prepared lump of clay he put it on his treadle wheel It was so fascinating to see how ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot I couldn t get that process out of my head so I looked forward to our return trip several months later to pick up the finished dinnerware One of my favorite features of each piece Grey had made was that upon close inspection one could see that the pieces had been individually inscribed with some marks on the underside just inside the trimmed foot On each of those pieces with the large foot area there was room for the inscription not only of the potter s signature address and date but also a unique saying or phrase A favorite family pastime then developed when guests came over and we got out the good stoneware Before my father served the food he would encourage guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the underside Thanks to his influence this childhood pastime has since become a habit Even today I still flip over all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch them to see if there might be an inscription or at least to look for the potter s mark Lantin decided on a necklace which had been one of his wife s favorites It must be worth at least seven or eight francs he thought because for an imitation piece the workmanship was very good He put it in his pocket and went looking for a reliable looking jeweler At length he saw one and went in a little ashamed of selling something so worthless Monsieur he said to the dealer I d like you to value this piece for me if you d be so kind The man took the article examined it turned it over weighed it and took up a magnifying glass to look at it more closely Lantin was a little embarrassed by all this ceremony and was about to say Look I m pretty sure it s got no value at all when the jeweler announced Monsieur I d put it at between and francs However I could not purchase this from you without knowing its exact provenance When induced to give spoken or written witness to something they doubt people will often feel bad about their deceit Nevertheless they begin to believe what they are saying When there is no compelling external explanation for one s words saying becomes believing Tory Higgins and his colleagues had university students read a personality description of someone and then summarize it for someone else who was believed either to like or to dislike this person The students wrote a more positive description when the recipient liked the person Having said positive things they also then liked the person more themselves Asked to recall what they had read they remembered the description as being more positive than it was In short it seems that we are prone to adjust our messages to our listeners and having done so to believe the altered message We want to stop watching so much TV but demonstrably we also want to watch lots of TV So what we really want it seems is to stop wanting We are trapped deep in a paradox deciding on the best course of action then doing something else The way around this is to see that habits are responses to needs This sounds obvious but countless efforts at habit change ignore its implications If you eat badly you might resolve to start eating well However if you are eating burgers and ice cream to feel comforted relaxed and happy try to replace them with broccoli and carrot juice is like dealing with a leaky bathroom tap by repainting the kitchen What is required is not a better diet but an alternative way to feel comforted and relaxed Back in the s Sholes Co a leading manufacturer of typewriters at the time received many complaints from users about typewriter keys sticking together if the operator went too fast In response management asked its engineers to figure out a way to prevent this from happening The engineers discussed the problem and then one of them said What if we slowed the operator down If we did that the keys would not jam together nearly as much The result was to have an inefficient keyboard configuration For example the letters O and I are the third and sixth most frequently used letters in the English language and yet the engineers positioned them on the keyboard so that the relatively weaker fingers had to depress them This inefficient logic pervaded the keyboard and solved the problem of keyboard jam up According to Cambodian legends lions once roamed the countryside attacking villagers and their precious buffalo and long before the great Khmer Empire began in the th century farmers developed a fierce martial art to defend themselves against the predator These techniques became bokator Meaning to fight a lion bokator is a martial art depicted on the walls of Angkor Wat There are moves to master mimicking animals such as monkeys elephants and even ducks King Jayavarman VII the warrior king who united Cambodia in the th century made his army train in bokator turning it into a fearsome fighting force Despite its long tradition in Cambodia bokator flourished when the Khmer Rouge took power in and executed most of the discipline s masters over the next four years My sister Tara was the quiet one in the family She was not as adventurous as my brother and I She never excelled at school or sports Of course I loved my sister but at times that was not so easy to do She seldom made eye contact with me When we ran into each other at school she sometimes pretended not to recognize me One day my father s job forced us to move to a new neighborhood The nurse at our new school Emerson gave us ear and eye exams our first ever I aced the tests Eagle eyes and elephant ears the nurse said but Tara struggled to read the eye chart She declared Tara severely shortsighted and she had to get glasses When the glasses were ready we all went downtown to pick them up The first time she tried them on she kept moving her head around and up and down What s the matter I asked You can see that tree over there she said pointing at a sycamore tree about a hundred feet away I nodded She sobbed I can see not just the branches but each little leaf Tara burst into tears On the way home she kept seeing for the first time all these things that most everyone else had stopped noticing She read street signs and billboards aloud She pointed out sparrows sitting on the telephone wires At home Tara insisted that I try on her glasses I put them on and the world turned into fuzzy unfocused shapes I took a few steps and banged my knee on the coffee table It was at that very moment that I truly understood Tara for the first time I realized why she did not like to go exploring or why she did not recognize me at school Tara loved seeing the world clearly Not long after she got her glasses she decided she wanted to be an artist She started compulsively drawing and painting all the wondrous things she was discovering Her first painting of the sycamore tree is still her favorite Today she is an art teacher at Emerson where she tries to bring the best out of each individual student John was as famous for his tennis skills as he was for his fits of temper on the court One afternoon I was playing an important singles match against John When things didn t go his way he began to go downhill complaining about the game screaming at himself and slamming his racket It looked like he was having a public nervous breakdown In the end the guy who didn t deserve to be on the same court with him won in three tough sets After the match John announced his retirement from tennis at the age of twenty seven He explained When I start losing to players like him I ve got to reconsider what I m doing even playing this game If he thought I d be insulted he was wrong In fact I loved it Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the creator of Sherlock Holmes had a great sense of delicacy where other persons feelings were concerned He once paid a visit to George Meredith the novelist when Meredith was old and weak Meredith suffered from an unusual disease that caused him to fall occasionally The two men were walking up a path toward Meredith s summerhouse Conan Doyle in the lead when Conan Doyle heard the old novelist fall behind him He judged by the sound which the fall was a mere slip and could not have hurt Meredith Therefore he did not turn and he strode on as if he had heard nothing He was a fiercely proud old man Conan Doyle later explained and my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up would be far greater than any relief I could give him There is an old Japanese legend about a man renowned for his flawless manners visiting a remote village Wanting to honor as well as observe him the villagers prepared a banquet As they sat to eat all eyes were on their noble guest Everyone looked at how the man held his chopsticks so that they could imitate him But then by an unfortunate accident as the mannered man raised a slippery slice of tofu to his lips he placed the tiniest bit of excess pressure on his chopsticks propelling his tofu through the air and onto his neighbor s lap After a brief moment of surprise in order to preserve the myth of their guest s perfection and keep him from any embarrassment all the villagers at the banquet began to fling tofu into each other s laps The traditional American view was that fences were out of place in the American landscape This notion turned up repeatedly in nineteenth century American writing about the landscape One author after another severely criticized the Englishman s insultingly inhospitable brick wall topped with broken bottles Frank J Scott an early landscape architect who had a large impact on the look of America s first suburbs worked tirelessly to rid the landscape of fences Writing in he held that to narrow our neighbors views of the free graces of Nature was unselfish and undemocratic To drive through virtually any American suburb today where every lawn steps right up to the street in a gesture of openness and welcoming is to see how completely such views have triumphed A case of the negative impact of an innovation was reported by a researcher examining the spread of the snowmobile among the Skolt Lapps in northern Finland The snowmobile offered considerable relative advantages to the Lapps who used reindeer sleds as their primary means of transportation It was much faster making trips for supplies more efficient However the snowmobile had disastrous effects on the Lapps First the noise of the snowmobile frightened the reindeer who in turn exhibited health problems and produced fewer calves each year Herd sizes were reduced further by herders who sold some of their reindeer to buy a snowmobile With smaller herds the Lapps found it more difficult to survive and the snowmobile was eventually viewed as a product that drove the Lapps into poverty Sometimes someone saying you can t do something is good for you It builds mental toughness and conviction I often tell people Anyone with young children will tell you if you ask them not to do something they re guaranteed to do it The following story is an example of how my dad used this to a his and ultimately my advantage As a child I wasn t particularly academic or ambitious and certainly didn t work very hard at my studies It wasn t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh grade and facing the prospect of leaving school without any sense of what I wanted to do as a career that I decided to apply to the local college to pursue further study Feeling pleased with myself for having made this monumental decision I proudly announced my plan to my dad e His immediate reaction was to say You ll never do that They ll never accept you I was so annoyed and upset by b his response that I worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year In those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended up winning three awards at the end of year prize giving The best part was being able to tell my dad that I d been awarded a place at college On hearing this news he simply lowered his newspaper and with a smile said Well done I always knew you would At that moment I realized what c he had done by discouraging me This was my first experience of reverse psychology Some people might say it s a risky strategy but it has certainly worked for me It has been extremely valuable in my life giving me the confidence determination and motivation to succeed even when the odds are stacked against me Now as a father myself I sometimes use the same technique to motivate my own son Often enough he ends up with favorable results I just hope one day d he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind A woman stopped at a flower shop to order some flowers to be wired to her mother who lived miles away As she got out of her car she noticed a girl sitting on the street sobbing The woman asked the girl what was wrong and she replied I wanted to buy a red rose for my mother but I only have cents and a rose costs two dollars She smiled and said Come on in with me I ll buy you a rose for your mother She placed her order of flowers to her mother and bought a rose for the girl As they were leaving she offered the girl a ride She responded Yes please if you could Take me to my mother The little girl directed her to a grave and placed the rose on it This changed the woman s plan She returned to the flower shop canceled the wire order picked up a bouquet of fresh roses and drove miles to meet her mother Mr Brown wanted his students to learn math in the context of real life He felt it was not enough for them just to work out problems from a book To show his students how math could really help them he held several contests during the year The contests allowed his students to have fun while they practiced math and raised money Once he filled a fishbowl with marbles asked the students to guess how many marbles there were and awarded a free lunch to the winner Another time they entered a contest to guess how many soda cans the back of a pickup truck was held To win they had to practice their skills at estimating multiplying dividing and measuring They used most of the prize money for an end of the year field trip It is hard for street trees to survive with only foot square holes in the pavement The average life of a street tree surrounded by concrete and asphalt is seven to fifteen years Many factors underground determine if a street tree will make it If the soil is so dense that the roots cannot get in it will surely die If they can get in there is a better chance of getting the water and nutrients needing to survive Another question is whether adequate water supplies are getting into the growing area Some of the water comes from underground sources and some from rain and it is hard to measure where the tree is getting it Of course if the roots get into the sewers they can get everything they need A blind spot is not the same as a simple lack of knowledge A blind spot emerges from a resistance to learning in a particular area At the root of many of our blind spots are a number of emotions or attitudes fear being the most obvious but also pride self satisfaction and anxiety A manager for example might have unsurpassed knowledge in the financial field but her understanding of people management might be limited Her people find her cold and aloof and want her to become more consultative and involved with the team She however is not willing to accept feedback about her management style and refuses to even consider the prospect of changing her management style The figure above shows the equipment for downhill and cross country skiing and their recommended sizes As you can see the downhill ski is shorter and wider than the cross country ski and is about the height of the skier The cross country ski meets the elbow when the arm is held above the head In either case a slightly heavier or more experienced skier might want a longer ski and a lighter or beginning skier might prefer a shorter ski The cross country pole is longer than the one for downhill skiing and its tip is bent The length of the cross country pole reaches the armpit The downhill pole fits comfortably in the hand about two inches below the armpit The bottom of the downhill boot attaches completely to the ski while the heel of the cross country boot is not fastened to the ski It was spring and some th grade boys at a suburban elementary school were fooling around on the playground They had discovered a great new trick One of them would kneel down behind someone and the other would push the person over The trick worked perfectly with Anna She fell over with ease She was hurt and crying In the process she had broken her wrist The yard duty staff sent the shaken boys to the principal The principal began by saying that she understood that they were playing and had not meant to cause serious harm but that in fact they had She explained that the girl would have to wear a cast for weeks and now lots of ordinary things would be more difficult for her She pointed out that the girl played the flute and would now not be able to play in the spring concert By the time she finished the boys were in tears and very sorry for what they had done The principal also suspended the boys for a day explaining to them that even though she knew they were sorry and had not meant to cause such harm she believed suspension was necessary to signal to everyone in the community the seriousness of the situation On their own the boys brought the girl flowers and apologized for hurting her Greg had always loved sports that he could play on his own When he was he went to a camp for skiers One of the best ways to stay in shape he was told there was cycling At that time his dad was trying to lose weight so he rode miles every day with his son Soon Greg got interested in cycling entered races for and year olds and won almost every race He became unbeatable in the U S However being number one in the U S didn t count for much because all the top cyclis ts raced in Europe When he was Greg started racing and winning in Europe And when he was he became the first non European to win the Tour de France the top cycling competition in the world The most useful thing I brought out of my childhood was confidence in reading Not long ago I went on a weekend self exploratory workshop in the hope of getting a clue about how to live One of the exercises we were given was to make a list of the ten most important events of our lives Number one was I was born and you could put whatever you liked after that Without even thinking about it my hand wrote at number two I learned to read I was born and learned to read wouldn t be a s equence that occurs to many people I imagine But I knew what I meant to say Being born was something done to me but my own life began when I first made out the meaning of a s entence Gas stations are a good example of an impersonal attitude At many stations attendants have even stopped pumping gas Motorists pull up to a gas station where an attendant is enclosed in a glass booth with a tray for taking money The driver must get out of the car pump the gas and walk over to the booth to pay And customers with engine trouble or a non functioning heater are usually out of luck Why Many gas stations have gotten rid of on duty mechanics The skillful mechanic has been replaced by a teenager in a uniform which doesn t know anything about cars and couldn t care less The key to a successful business chain can be expressed in one word uniformity In the early s a farm activist viewed the emerging fast food industry as a step toward a food economy dominated by giant corporations Much of what he worried about has come to pass The tremendous success of the fast food industry has caused other industries to adopt similar business methods The basic thinking behind fast food has become the operating system of today s economy wiping out small business and eliminating regional differences So if you walk into a world famous fast food restaurant anywhere in the world you can purchase food with almost the same taste A screw is a simple mechanical device that multiplies effort The force that you apply to the screw is called the effort force whereas the force that applies to the object in response to the effort force is called the output force The spiral ridges are the threads of the screw The distance from head to thread is called the pitch The diagram shows how turning the head of the screw can cause the screw to move into the object The distance around the head of the screw is related to the distance the effort moves The distance through which the output moves corresponds to the pitch of the screw The gym teacher walked into the room and recognized that I had been fighting with Matt He sent us out to the running track He followed us with a smile on his face and said I want both of you to run the track holding each other s hands The class captain erupted into a roar of laughter and we were embarrassed beyond belief Hesitantly my enemy and I started running What had earlier been fists were now linked in a strange handshake At some point during the course of the obligatory mini marathon that both of us felt anger about I remember looking over at the large person bes ide me His nose was still bleeding a bit Tears filled his eyes His giant body slowed him down Suddenly it struck me that here was a person not all that different from myself I guess my unwilling partner thought the same thing because we both looked at each other and began to laugh In time we became good friends I no longer saw the big figure in the same light Instead of the dull boy who I had hated for a long time here was someone like me the human being who had internal value and worth far beyond any externals It was amazing what I had learned from being forced to run hand in hand with someone For the rest of my life I have never raised a hand against another person Many people believe that a snowflake cannot last more than a few minutes indoors because it is a frozen water crystal However you can catch a snowflake and keep it forever According to the chemist Tryggvi Emlisson superglue can be used to do this job It is a thin runny glue with special molecules which hardens anything it touches With that in mind Emlisson did an experiment with a snowflake in January He took a snowflake locked it in a drop of the superglue and kept it for decades Recently he showed that it was still well preserved Philosophy is simply put a way of thinking More accurately however it is a set of mental tools And that fact is directly related to the question of why we study philosophy It s not just to amaze our friends with our own profound thinking or confuse them with unexpected questions although some college students may value that poss ibility the most in taking philosophy cours es We study philosophy because of the mental skills it helps us develop College life is busy There are too many demands on your schedule Activities friends and pastimes may cause some difficulties in your performing the real job at hand When you are feeling overwhelmed by presentations paper deadlines or tests you will probably spend all your time studying to deal with these pressures However this lack of time for relaxation makes it more difficult get the most out of your studies Promise yourself that no matter how much work you have you will always relax during one full evening You will work better if you take time off for relaxation Although we eat bananas often few of us know much about them The banana tree is the largest plant on earth without a woody stem The trunk contains a large amount of water and is extremely delicate Though it can reach a full height of feet in one year even moderate winds can blow it down The fruit s tem or bunch is made up of s even to nine hands each containing to fingers which grow slowly through a mass of tightly packed leaf covers Just before they ripen they are picked packaged and finally delivered to our local supermarkets A bicycle is a two wheeled steerable machine that is pedaled by the rider s feet The wheels are installed in line in a metal frame with the front wheel held in a rotatable fork The frame which is diamond shaped is formed by two triangles of tubes The main triangle consis ts of the top tube the seat tube and the down tube while the front triangle consists of the seat tube chain stays and seat s tays The saddle fits on top of the seat tube The rider s its on a saddle and steers by turning handlebars that are attached to the fork The feet turn pedals linked to cranks We tend to believe that our taste in music is a great way of expressing our individuality but sociologists at Columbia University claim that we only like the music we listen to because we know others enjoy it Using a specially developed website they offered more than people the opportunity to download free music They discovered that people who were given popularity rankings were more likely to select what the website claimed were favorite choices When a concert violinist was asked the secret of her success she replied Planned neglect Then she explained When I was in school there were many things that were demanded my time and energy When I went to my room after breakfast I made my bed straightened the room dusted the floor and did whatever else came to my attention Then I hurried to violin practice I found I wasn t progressing as I thought I should so I reversed things Until my practice period was completed I deliberately neglected everything else That program of planned neglect I believe accounts for my success When you find work you love that supports you financially that is ideal Hundreds of people have told me that when they do work they love such as teaching students or nursing elderly people they don t need as much money because they are happy When people are not happy in their work they have a tendency to want more money because they are unfulfilled by their work Even if your work does not satisfy you it puts food on the table for you and your loved ones Working for survival is not ideal but you do what you have to do to live This is a highly efficient headgear It is a light and soft cap with elastic pads that stiffen upon collision It doesn t protect you as much as a hard helmet says the Swiss businessman who released this product first but it s for people who don t like to wear helmets The pads on the cap are made of a special material that loosens in response to quick movements or impacts Strike your head and the shock causes the molecules inside the padding to tightly bond forming a structure that resembles a chain link fence This stiffening helps absorb and redistribute the force of the impact My name is Caroline Finch I live in Albuquerque New Mexico In the downtown area I often see homeless people begging for money all around the stoplights I used to give a lot of money to them feeling sorry for their misfortune But as time passed I became a single mom with no home a huge debt and hardly any income As a result I became very bitter and stopped giving to the people on the side of the road Eventually things started to change for me I became responsible enough to have a home a backyard for my daughter and plenty of food I saved money and started to pull myself out of debt One day we saw a homeless person with the sign Will work for food I passed by My daughter commented Mommy you used to give to those people in need I replied Honey they just use that money for alcohol or other bad things She didn t respond But when I said that it didn t feel right Three days later I was driving to pick up my daughter from school A man was standing on the corner and something deep inside me said Just help the guy So I rolled down my window and he ran over with enthusiasm He said God bless you I only need cents I reached into my ashtray and oddly enough there sat three quarters and two pennies My hair stood up when I saw this I picked them up and gave them to him He burst out with joy and tears in his eyes Wow you just made it possible for me to see my mom for Christmas Thank you so much The bus that has this great Christmas discount is leaving in minutes It was a moment I ll never forget I think that man won t forget it either but I was the one who got the best gift in life No one should allow himself or herself to be emotionally hurt by anyone But over the course of a friendship even the most considerate people can make mistakes resulting in misunderstandings A relationship can suffer if the offender refuses to make the first move toward reconciliation In this situation it may be best if the offended person takes the initiative and tries to restore their friendship This can be done by discussing why one person got cross or failed to understand the circumstances to make someone dis appointed by not doing something they are expecting you to do The kids will be let down when they hear you can t come after all to make someone or something likely to fail The whole sys tem is let down by the poor quality control to allow someone or something to move to a lower position The thirsty traveler carefully let down the bucket into the well Commercials on TV tell us all the time that we can change ourselves In thirty seconds actors on commercials can get thinner prettier and richer But this fantasy world only sets up us for a fall We hear about the wonderful changes people can make in their lives and we want to duplicate thos e results But when we try and are not quickly rewarded we actually wind up feeling worse than we did before we started The problem is that change is possible but it takes years to achieve the desired outcome Many public figures have hired speech writers for political or business purposes You may have heard such well known phrases as Read my lips or A kinder gentler nation A female professional speech writer is credited with creating these phrases capturing abstract ideas and putting them into practical language The very existence of speech writers like her causes many politicians or business people to think that if they just hire a good speech writer they will become memorable speech makers overnight Unfortunately that assumption is wrong In reality speech writers cannot make their clients great or even good speakers My father used to have a great build when he was younger But a lot of beer has gone down since then and now he is very fat He insists on sitting around the house in his swimming trunks When my friends come over I m embarrassed My mother doesn t like it either Every now and then she says Harold go and put on a robe But he pays no attention My father is wonderful and I love all pounds of him but do you think he should sit in the living room in his swimwear when I have company An old gentleman had been hired by a young town councilman to clear away the sand from the pools of water up in the mountain that fed the spring flowing through their town With faithful silent regularity he patrolled the hills removed the leaves and branches and cleared away the sand that would otherwise have choked and contaminated the fresh flow of water The village soon became a popular resort for vacationers Graceful swans floated along the clear spring the mill wheels turned day and night and the view from restaurants was picturesque beyond description Years passed One evening the town council held its meeting As they reviewed the budget one man s eye caught the salary figure being paid to the obscure keeper of the spring Said the keeper of the purse Who is this old man Why do we keep him on year after year For all we know the strange ranger of the hills is not doing anything He isn t necessary any longer So they decided to dispense with the old man s services In early autumn the trees began to shed their leaves Small branches fell into the pools hindering the rushing flow of sparkling water A few days later the water turned yellowish brown Within another week a foul smell was detected The mill wheels moved more slowly and ground to a halt The swans left as did the tourists Immediately the embarrassed council called an urgent meeting Realizing their gross error in judgment they rehired the old keeper of the spring and within a few weeks the spring began to clear up The wheels started to turn and life returned to the town By the age of one and a half Matilda knew as many words as most grown ups The parents instead of prais ing her called her a noisy chatterbox and told her that small girls should be seen and not heard By the time she was three Matilda had taught herself to read by studying newspapers and magazines that lay around the house At the age of four she could read fast and well In most states people who have been adopted are not allowed to have access to their files They have no idea who their real parents are or why they were put up for adoption and all their attempts to discover this information are met with firm resistance from the government In short adoption officials will tell them nothing However in the past decade many adoptees have publicly protested this situation and some states have changed their previous policies Indeed this change in adoption policy should take place nationwide Adoptees need to know about their parents and their past and those who do not care can simply refuse access to their files Although restrictions against opening adoption files make the search much harder they do not necessarily discourage those adoptees who want to discover who their biological parents are Those men and women who are desperate to find what they want to know will if they can afford it hire a detective to find out If not some of them are willing to devote all their time and energy to finding more about their origins Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature It also is part of the process of selection by which biological evolution functions Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young In some circumstances it may pave the way for genetic variants to take hold in the population of a species and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of the old one Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make possible the good of greater diversity Starvation can be of practical or instrumental value even as it is an intrinsic disvalue What some organisms must starve in nature is deeply regrettable and sad The statement remains implacably true even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends that are good For every toxic substance process or product in use today there is a safer alternative either already in existence or waiting to be discovered through the application of human intellect ingenuity and effort In almost every case the safer alternative is available at a comparable cost Industry may reject these facts and complain about the high cost of acting but history sets the record straight The chemical industry denied that there were practical alternatives to ozone depleting chemicals predicting not only economic disaster but numerous deaths because food and vaccines would spoil without refrigeration They were wrong The motor vehicle industry initially denied that cars caused air pollution then claimed that no technology existed to reduce pollution from vehicles and later argued that installing devices to reduce air pollution would make cars extremely expensive They were wrong every time The pesticide industry argues that synthetic pesticides are absolutely necessary to grow food Thousands of organic farmers are proving them wrong c As a couple start to form a relationship they can be seen to develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and in particular how it is similar or different to their parents relationship The couple s initial disclosures involve them forming constructs about how much similarity there is between them and each other s families What each of them will remember is selective and coloured by their family s constructs system In turn it is likely that as they tell each other their already edited stories there is a second process of editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again interpreted within their respective family of origin s construct systems The two sets of memories the person talking about his or her family and the partner s edited version of this story go into the cooking pot of the couple s new construct system Subsequently one partner may c randomly recall a part of the other s story as a tactic in negotiations for example Harry may say to Doris that she is being bossy just like her mother Since this is probably based on what Doris has told Harry this is likely to be a very powerful tactic She may protest or attempt to rewrite this version of her story thereby possibly adding further material that Harry could use in this way These exchanges of stories need not always be employed in such malevolent ways These reconstructed memories can become very powerful to a point where each partner may become confused even about the simple factual details of what actually did happen in their past Over the last week Jason had been feeling worried about his daughter Sally For two months now Sally had been absorbed perhaps even excessively in studying birds He was afraid she might begin to ignore her schoolwork While shopping Jason was glad to run into his old friend Jennifer a bird expert working at the local university Maybe she could help ease his concern Upon hearing about Sally s interest Jennifer invited them both to visit her office to see just how deep Sally s fascination was Two days later Jason and Sally visited Jennifer s office Sally was delighted by the books about birds and she joyfully looked at the beautiful pictures in them It was while Jason and Jennifer were talking that Sally suddenly shouted Oh I ve seen this bird Impossible replied Jennifer not believing it This book shows rare birds You can t see any of them around here But she insisted I spotted a pair of them in their nest in a huge oak tree nearby Jennifer walked up to Sally and took a close look at the page She calmly said That s the black robin of Chathas Island It s one of the rarest birds Sally You couldn t have seen it in this town Yet Sally persisted In that case can you show me the nest asked Jennifer Yes I can right now if you want answered Sally full of confidence Jennifer put on her coat pulled out a pair of binoculars and stepped out Sally and Jason followed Approaching the tree Sally shouted excitedly There that s the nest Jennifer looked up to see a small cup shaped nest within a fork of the branches Quickly she took out her binoculars and peered where Sally pointed In the fading evening light she found the two rare black birds in their nest See didn t I tell you exclaimed Sally Looking at her in joyful surprise both Jason and Jennifer were proud of Sally They now recognized her extraordinary gift and passion as a bird watcher The lack of real direct experience in and with nature has caused many children to regard the natural world as mere abstraction that fantastic beautifully filmed place filled with endangered rainforests and polar bears in peril This overstated often fictionalized version of nature is no more real and yet no less real to them than the everyday nature right outside their doors waits to be discovered in a child s way at a child s pace Consider the University of Cambridge study which found that a group of eight year old children was able to identify substantially more characters from animations than common wildlife species One wonders whether our children s inherent capacity to recognize classify and order information about their environment abilities once essential to our very survival is slowly devolving to facilitate life in their increasingly virtualized world It s all part of what Robert Pyle first called the extinction of experience Why does the pure acting of the movies not seem unnatural to the audience who after all are accustomed in real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct Most people s perception in these matters is not very sharp They are not in the habit of observing closely the play of features of their fellow men either in real life or at the movies They are satisfied with grasping the meaning of what they see Thus they often take in the overemphasized expression of film actors more easily than any that is too naturalistic And as far as lovers of art are concerned they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for art They know that artistic representation is always explaining refining and making clear the object depicted Things that in real life are imperfectly realized merely hinted at and entangled with other things appear in a work of art complete entire and free from irrelevant matters This is also true of acting in film Most of us probably parent the way we were parented Louise a mother who attended my seminars shared how her mother dealt with sibling fighting Louise said her mother s infamous threat was always If you kids don t stop fighting I m going to knock your three heads together Louise and her siblings were always puzzled about the specifics of how their mother would actually accomplish such a task which thankfully she never attempted But what drove her mother to make this empty threat Extreme annoyance with the sibling arguments probably No doubt Louise s mother had learned this threatening tactic from her own mother and in the absence of any other parenting tools she knew of she said it to her own children regardless of whether it worked If Louise had not learned the effective parenting skills taught in the seminars she would probably be using similarly ineffective threatening techniques with her own children today An important lesson to remember is that we should try to see the positives in life even while we are stuck in the middle of trouble Riccardo who was named after his father an immigrant from Mexico learned this lesson at a young age Although the family called him Ricky his father had his own nickname for him Good for Nothing Why did the elder Riccardo call him that Because Ricky hated fishing His father saw this very negatively because he was a fisherman He loved the fishing business So did all of his sons except for Good for Nothing Ricky The boy did not like being on the boat and the smell of fish made him sick Instead Ricky who was not afraid of hard work delivered newspapers shined shoes worked in the office and even repaired nets His income went to the family Even so his father was strongly dissatisfied with him and still always said that he was good for nothing Since these jobs were not fishing his father saw no value in them Young Ricky hated fishing Everything would be fine if it were not fishing he thought to himself Soon Ricky began to follow his older brother who used to play sandlot ball For Ricky playing baseball with him was a way to forget his hardship Fortunately Ricky was very good at it and was treated like a hero among his playmates When Ricky was sixteen he decided to drop out of school to become a baseball player And by the time he was through with baseball he had become a legend The nation came to know Ricky as the most complete player of his generation and he was voted into the Hall of Fame And his father the elder Riccardo what did he think about it Though he had wanted all of his sons to join the family business he was finally proud of Ricky and respected his accomplishments Ricky held onto hope in one of the most difficult moments of his life and achieved greatness Like life in traditional society but unlike other team sports baseball is not governed by the clock A football game is comprised of exactly sixty minutes of play a basketball game forty or forty eight minutes but baseball has no set length of time within which the game must be completed The pace of the game is therefore leisurely and unhurried like the world before the discipline of measured time deadlines schedules and wages paid by the hour Baseball belongs to the kind of world in which people did not say I haven t got all day Baseball games do have all day to be played But that does not mean that they can go on forever Baseball like traditional life proceeds according to the rhythm of nature specifically the rotation of the Earth During its first half century games were not played at night which meant that baseball games like the traditional work day ended when the sun set You can t have a democracy if you can t talk with your neighbors about matters of mutual interest or concern Thomas Jefferson who had an enduring interest in democracy came to a similar conclusion He was prescient in understanding the dangers of concentrated power whether in corporations or in political leaders or exclusionary political institutions Direct involvement of citizens was what had made the American Revolution possible and given the new republic vitality and hope for the future Without that involvement the republic would die Eventually he saw a need for the nation to be subdivided into wards political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process The representatives for each ward in the capital would have to be responsive to citizens organized in this way A vibrant democracy conducted locally would then provide the active basic unit for the democratic life of the republic With that kind of involvement the republic might survive and prosper Harumi Tanaka from Osaka Japan had accepted an assignment in Boston His task was to explore the possibility of developing joint ventures with American firms He had been invited by one company to spend a month there and had been assigned an office and a research assistant Harumi agreed on a Monday to present a business plan the following Friday On Tuesday the computers in the company crashed and the research assistant called in sick with a severe case of the flu Still Harumi pushed forward and presented his plan on Friday He began his presentation I m sorry that I am not well prepared This meeting may not be a good use of your time He then went into a clear interesting presentation After the meeting one of the American executives said I don t know why you had to apologize Everyone knows about the computer crash and your assistant s illness Harumi responded that he thought that the apology would be a good introduction to his presentation What interested me the most about the new house was the stable in the backyard in which my father let me make a small space for a pony I believed that it meant that I would get a pony for Christmas He also said Lennie someday you ll have a pony of your own However some day is a pain to a boy who lives in and knows only now Meanwhile my father took me to a pony fair and let me try some ponies but he always found some fault with them leaving me in despair When Christmas was at hand I had abandoned all hope of getting one Instead I hung up the biggest stocking I had Waking up at a m my little sisters and I raced for the fireplace downstairs While my sisters were delighted to find their stockings filled with presents mine was empty I went out into the yard and wept all by myself After an hour my frustration reached its climax when I saw a man riding a pony with a brand new saddle When he looked at our door he just passed by which caused me to break into a flood of tears Then he said Kid do you know a boy named Lennie Steffens That s me I replied in tears He said I ve been looking all over for your house Why don t you put your house number where it can be seen He went on saying I should have been here at Your father told me to bring the pony here and leave him for you I d never seen anything so beautiful as my pony And finally I rode off into the fields Thrilled by riding I began to feast my eyes on the world around me The trees seemed to be taking on smiling faces and the birds seemed to be singing to congratulate me on getting my new friend When I returned home my father asked Why did you come back so soon With a smile on my face I answered him I didn t want to make him feel tired It s his first day with me He laughed and wiped away the tear stains from my face his heartfelt gesture of apology for such a long delayed present Bursting with happiness I spent the rest of the day brushing my pony in the stable The Internet and communication technologies play an ever increasing role in the social lives of young people in developed societies Adolescents have been quick to immerse themselves in technology with most using the Internet to communicate Young people treat the mobile phone as an essential necessity of life and often prefer to use text messages to communicate with their friends Young people also increasingly access social networking websites As technology and the Internet are a familiar resource for young people it is logical what they would seek assistance from this source This has been shown by the increase in websites that provide therapeutic information for young people A number of youth friendly mental health websites have been developed The information presented often takes the form of Frequently Asked Questions fact sheets and suggested links It would seem therefore logical to provide online counselling for young people An Egyptian executive after entertaining his Canadian guest offered him joint partnership in a new business venture The Canadian delighted with the offer suggested that they meet again the next morning with their respective lawyers to finalize the details The Egyptian never showed up The surprised and disappointed Canadian tried to understand what had gone wrong Did Egyptians lack punctuality Was the Egyptian expecting a counter offer Were lawyers unavailable in Cairo None of these explanations proved to be correct rather the problem was caused by the different meaning Canadians and Egyptians attach to inviting lawyers The Canadian regarded the lawyers absence as facilitating the successful completion of the negotiation the Egyptian interpreted it as signaling the Canadian s mistrust of his verbal commitment Canadians often use the impersonal formality of a lawyer s services to finalize agreements Egyptians by contrast more frequently depend on the personal relationship between bargaining partners to accomplish the same purpose Dad just laughed and walked out of the room still holding Slade in his arms He had dressed him and now he put him in his chair As Slade sat in his chair eating a biscuit that Dad had spread with butter and homemade strawberry jam Mom walked into the kitchen She took one look at her little boy and started laughing his little face and hands were covered with biscuit and jam She thought how really cute he was Honey what have you done Look at him I will never get him clean again I guess when he gets through eating you can take him out and dump him in the bathtub Dad laughed Slade giggled and tried to spit biscuit all over Dad It didn t hit him because luckily he avoided the spray That made Mom laugh even more and soon the little cabin was full of love and laughter Peter Anderson was exhausted when he finally opened the front door of his apartment He teaches first graders which means he lives in a world of riddles birthday cakes and pointless stories His world is dominated by year olds Throwing himself with his leather bag on the long comfortable sofa he closed his eyes and reviewed the events of the day Today was especially busy and wearying and Anderson wondered whether he was really suitable for teaching He was stressed as kids constantly sought his attention At snack time Emily wanted him to open her milk carton so he did As she was drinking Scott spilled his milk and Anderson had to help him clean it up Then Jenny Andrew Mark and Kids never ceased However he still loved them That s also what he had said in the interview for the position It was held in a seminar room where Anderson met the principal for the first time three years ago The principal asked why he chose to work with young children He answered that he loved helping children learn to write their names for the first time finding someone a new friend and sharing in the joy of reading But as time passed his commitment and passion seemed to fade gradually He recalled his strong conviction during the interview That s why Anderson took the job in the first place even though some of his friends attempted to persuade him to be a lawyer or businessman He shook his head and opened his eyes As he struggled to get up he saw something fall from his bag It was a birthday card from his students decorated with all kinds of odd shaped but colorful hearts and scribbled names Dear Mr Anderson happy birthday to you It s our surprise gift for you We love you Anderson could not help but smile He already felt much better The term objectivity is important in measurement because of the scientific demand that observations be subject to public verification A measurement system is objective to the extent that two observers evaluating the same performance arrive at the same or very similar measurements For example using a tape measure to determine the distance a javelin was thrown yields very similar results regardless of who reads the tape By comparison evaluation of performances such as diving gymnastics and figure skating is more subjective although elaborate scoring rules help make it more objective From the point of view of research in motor behavior it is important to use performances in the laboratory for which the scoring can be as objective as possible A special feature of the real estate rental market is its tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction phase more so than with manufactured products When the supply of a manufactured product exceeds the demand the manufacturer cuts back on output and the merchant reduces inventory to balance supply and demand However property owners cannot reduce the amount of space available for rent in their buildings Space that was constructed to accommodate business and consumer needs at the peak of the cycle remains so vacancy rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point the maximum that must be charged in order to cover operating expenses Some owners will take space off the market rather than lose money on it A few unable to subsidize the property will sell at distress prices and lenders will repossess others These may then be placed on the market at lower rental rates further depressing the market Born in Budapest to a family of bankers von Neumann was undeniably bright At age eight he had mastered calculus At age twelve he was reading works aimed at professional mathematicians But he also loved to invent mechanical toys and became a child expert on Byzantine history When it was time to go off to university he agreed to study chemical engineering as a compromise with his father who feared that his son couldn t make a living as a mathematician Von Neumann kept his bargain by enrolling at the University of Budapest and promptly leaving for Berlin where he spent his time doing mathematics and returning to Budapest at the end of every semester to take examinations He published his second mathematics paper in which he gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers at age nineteen By age twenty five he had published ten major papers by age thirty nearly three dozen Jim Nelson a junior at Manti High School was an outstanding athlete He had just made the school basketball team one of the best in the state But on October most of his athletic future was suddenly taken away from him Jim was riding his bicycle at night to visit his friend The road was very steep in some places It was very dark and difficult to see As he came around a sloping curve on his bicycle Jim hit a car parked on the side of the road He ended up in the hospital Besides bad cuts on his head he broke his right arm and was in a cast for two months Jim s doctor gave him a series of tests The doctor concluded that he had suffered nerve damage and that he might never regain the full use of his right arm Because of his injury Jim wasn t able to play on the basketball team during the rest of that year but the coach did make him equipment manager so that he could come and practice All summer long in each and every night he practiced making left handed baskets When the next season arrived Jim was ready to try out for the team and he made it again Jim never became a starter but he was always the first substitute to go in the game Jim got a chance to play in the last seconds of the championship game when a starting player sprained his ankle With seconds left Jim balanced the ball in his left hand and took the shot The crowd was deathly quiet until swish He made the three point shot left handed Jim won not only the game but also the hearts of his teammates for proving that with determination no obstacle is too great B B I was reminded of our mission earlier this year when my mother sold her house Because of my father s failing health my parents recently moved from Florida to Maryland to live with my elder sister and her family At my mom s request my brothers sisters and I sorted through all her belongings She told us to keep or discard whatever we pleased For myself I kept a solitary piece of china one of the few remaining plates from the set my grandfather bought my mother for her wedding I can still remember the set in better days serving many a guest on a Sunday afternoon But its comrades have all been broken or have disappeared and this plate is all I have It is delicate and faded you can no longer read the pattern name printed on the back But it hangs in my dining room as a pleasant reminder of her hospitality B It had long been something of a mystery where and on what the northern fur seals of the eastern Pacific feed during the winter which they spend off the coast of North America from California to Alaska There is no evidence that they are feeding to any great extent on sardines mackerel or other commercially important fishes Presumably four million seals could not compete with commercial fishermen for the same species without the fact being But there is some evidence on the diet of the fur seals and it is highly significant Their stomachs have yielded the bones of a species of fish that has never been seen alive Indeed not even its remains have been found anywhere except in the stomachs of seals Ichthyologists say that this seal fish belongs to a group that typically inhabits very deep water off the edge of the continental shelf B Occasionally there are children who have trouble understanding that their clothing choice is inappropriate or even unhealthy Some children follow the suggestion that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day For those kids experience may be the best teacher For example when Lydia was eight years old she insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and slush Her mom worried that she would arrive at school with cold wet feet but Lydia would not change her mind Of course her mother was right While Lydia did have some very uncomfortable toes because they became soaked and frozen on her way to and from school she learned that sometimes fashion isn t worth the price of serious discomfort B To be creative problem solvers people must learn to approach complexity with a certain naive simplicity And by letting their thinking become more free they can improve their chances of discovering new unencumbered perceptions of old problems or entirely new creations For this they can mentally play with the ideas in a childlike manner Here is an example story In a small Moravian village at the time of the old Austrian empire an inspector from the Ministry of Education arrived one day to visit the schoolroom It was part of his duty to make such periodic inspections of the schools At the end of the hour after he had observed the class he stood up and said I am glad to see that you children are doing well in your studies I am satisfied with your progress Therefore before I go there is one question I would like to ask How many hairs does a horse have Very quickly one little nine year old boy raised his hand to the astonishment of the teacher and the visitor He stood up and said The horse has hairs The inspector wonderingly asked And how do you know that this is the right number The boy replied If you do not believe me you could count them yourself The inspector broke into loud laughter thoroughly enjoying the boy s remark As the teacher escorted him along the aisle to the door still laughing heartily he said What an amusing story I must tell this story to my colleagues when I return to Vienna I can already see how they will take it they enjoy nothing better than a good joke And with that he took his leave It was a year later and the inspector was back again at the village school for his annual visit As the teacher was walking along the aisle with him to the door he stopped and said By the way Mr Inspector how did your colleagues like the story of the horse and the number of his hairs The inspector slapped the teacher on the back Oh yes he said you know I was really very anxious to tell that story and a fine story it was but you see I wasn t able for the life of me to remember the number of hairs A A You cannot fit objects that occupied a square foot house in a square foot condominium If you are moving to a smaller condominium that s great Get rid of your belongings and buy the condominium It is fruitless to look at condominiums when you have spent the past odd years in a large house and then try to move all of your life into the smaller investment To do so often leads to frustration because what you wind up purchasing is an expensive warehouse for your furniture and that is usually the wrong investment If you want to change your lifestyle you must accept the consequences of that decision Throwing things out only hurt for a little while A Occasionally there are children who have trouble understanding that their clothing choice is inappropriate or even unhealthy Some children follow the suggestion that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day For those kids experience may be the best teacher For example when Lydia was eight years old she insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and slush Her mom worried that she would arrive at school with cold wet feet but Lydia would not change her mind Of course her mother was right While Lydia did have some very uncomfortable toes because they became soaked and frozen on her way to and from school she learned that sometimes fashion isn t worth the price of serious discomfort A The school orchestra was practicing in the auditorium and Mr Grey was clapping his hands to mark the rhythm when he heard the town emergency siren Stop Everyone he shouted Then he ran to the door and pushed it open But a burst of wind slammed the door right back and it hit him hard He fell down and didn t move Janet was the oldest kid And she knew instantly This was a tornado Kids were shocked to see Mr Grey fall down and they began screaming Nikki put her mouth next to Janet s ear and yelled We need help Janet was scared too but she fought the fear Janet pulled Nikki and ran over to the grand piano She grabbed the whistle out of her bag and blew it hard three times Every kid on the stage turned to look at Janet In three seconds all kids were gathered around her Looking at the kids around her Janet yelled as loudly as she could Rick and Matt get Mr Grey on that cart and roll him over here Everyone else grab the music stands and bring them next to the piano Hurry When everyone came back Janet asked five of them to follow They ran to where the curtain hung along the wall of the stage Janet grabbed the edge of the curtain and screamed Everyone grab hold and pull When the curtain fell they pulled it over the tops of the music stands and the grand piano Then she motioned everyone to get under the curtain The wind noise rose again but Janet was now safely hidden inside the piano and curtain fort with the rest of the orchestra Relieved they thanked one another and felt oneness in their hearts A king once boarded a galley ship As he passed the crew of slaves he asked several of them what their offenses were Almost every man claimed he was innocent They laid the blame on someone else One young fellow however spoke out Sire I deserve to be here I stole some money No one is at fault but myself I m guilty Upon hearing this the king seized him by the shoulder and shouted You scoundrel What are you doing here with all these honest men Get out of their company at once He was then set free The key to this prisoner s freedom was the admission of his guilt Remember what it was like to report on a daily deadline for the first time Or to interview a city official for the first time Or to begin to maneuver a desktop publishing program We know that the journalism program at our college was a source of many of these firsts for you We re still providing these important first experiences to budding young writers and editors And we re hoping you ll be willing to help these students make it through the program As you know the costs of providing first rate education just keep going up We ve done everything we can to contain costs without compromising quality One of those things is to set up a scholarship fund for students with special financial needs We hope you would consider contributing generously to our fund You ll get a great feeling knowing you re helping support the formation of future leaders in the profession Today the world of innovation is far different from what it was a century ago The days of the solitary inventor working on his own are gone To oversimplify basic ideas bubble out of universities and laboratories in which a group of researchers work together both major breakthroughs like understanding the genetic structure of life and smaller ones such as advances in mathematics or basic chemistry Traditionally intellectual property has played little role in promoting basic science Academia believes in open architecture meaning that the knowledge that research produces should be made public to encourage innovation The great scientists are driven by an inner quest to understand the nature of the universe the extrinsic reward that matters most to them are the recognition of their peers Over the course of the past forty years no country on earth has cut its alcohol consumption more than France While consumption of beer and spirits has stayed basically steady in France the per capita consumption of alcohol from wine fell from liters in to about in One reason for the dwindling wine consumption is the acceleration of the French meal In the average French meal lasted minutes Plenty of time for half a bottle if not a whole bottle Today the average French meal has been slashed down to minutes Wine is a victim of the disappearance of the leisurely meal It is not the target of the change but the decline in wine consumption is a cause of the emergence of the faster more modern on the go lifestyle One of the most commonly cited reasons for keeping a pet animal is for the companionship it can provide The general term companionship usually translates into partaking in shared activities such as walking the dog playing with the cat However such behavioral interactions between humans and pet animals are usually asymmetrically organized Humans tend to interact with their pets when they feel like it rather than consistently responding to the animal s demands for attention In addition it is often observed that once interaction between humans and pets has arisen the termination of such interactional sequences invariably originates from the human This suggests that activities like walking the dog and playing with the cat only arise when time can be spared from the human owner s other commitments Therefore if one views activity as a global concept involving instigation performance and termination labeling certain forms of human pet interaction as shared activities may be appealing Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes visited her house after school Her mother was stern and meticulous about house cleaning My mother on the other hand did not care as much about a messy house She had sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the laundry to pile up In the midst of her chores my mother spent time reading This was her time away from endless hours of child care and housework Unironed school blouses and a dirty kitchen might make her feel guilty but her reading never did One day as I played in Maureen s clean house her mom fixed me with her cool gray eyes and said Your mother s nice but she reads too much I was stunned The next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of sunlight I studied her in the doorway and decided her apron could use a washing Shame flushed through me Reading was the cause pleasure reading in broad daylight Silently I made vows that would keep me from sharing my mother s fate I tried my best not to follow in her footsteps but I didn t know that it was already too late for me The way I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I was already like my mother The years passed in a blur of covertly turned pages until I was a grown up schoolteacher with a husband and children of my own I struggled mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen daylight My only guiltless reading occurred at night when the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids were in bed I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as well Off I d go to work each day passing on the gift of reading to my students I d watch as they discovered they could read and make sense of the letters and the words on a page All over the world there was agreement that this was important as important as eating or thinking or working And then one day I finally understood what she had tried to show us that reading was housework of the very best kind Switching on the light in the nursery Evelyn found her baby daughter Julie tossing feverishly and giving out odd little cries She put her hand against Julie s cheeks They were burning With an exclamation she followed her baby s arm down under the cover until she found her little hand The whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in the center was a little inflamed sore She rushed to the phone Doctor Foulke the family physician sounded upset at being called out of bed at midnight She ran back to the nursery to check on her daughter Taking a closer look she found her thumb to be somewhat more swollen She knelt beside the bed and began smoothing back Julie s hair over and over You have to pay close attention to someone s normal pattern in order to notice a deviation from it when he or she lies Sometimes the variation is as subtle as a pause Other times it is obvious and abrupt I recently saw a news interview with an acquaintance who I was certain was going to lie about a few particularly sensitive issues and lie she did During most of her interview she was calm and direct but when she started lying her manner changed dramatically she threw her head back laughed in disbelief and shook her head back and forth It is true that the questions dealt with very personal issues but I have found that in general no matter how touchy the question if a person is telling the truth his or her manner will not change significantly or abruptly way we explore and learn about the vast detailed intricacy of human culture and individual behavior And it is importantly the way in which most cultural anthropologists earn and maintain their professional standing Some of the early personal accounts of anthropologists in the field make fieldwork sound exciting adventuresome certainly exotic sometimes easy Malinowski the classic anthropological fieldworker describes the early stages of fieldwork as a strange sometimes unpleasant sometimes intensely interesting adventure which soon adopts quite a natural course He goes on to describe his daily routine of strolling through the village observed the intimate details of family life and as he tells it such observations seem possible and accessible From the twelve million articles on Wikipedia to the millions of free secondhand goods offered on websites we are discovering that money is not the only motivator Altruism has always existed but the Web gives it a platform where the actions of individuals can have global impact In a sense zero cost distribution has turned sharing into an industry From the point of view of the monetary economy it all looks free indeed it looks like unfair competition but that says more about our shortsighted ways of measuring value than it does about the worth of what is created The incentives to share can range from reputation and attention to less measurable factors such as expression fun satisfaction and simply self interest Sometimes the giving is unintentional You give information to Google when you have a public website whether you intend to or not and you give aluminum cans to the homeless guy who collects them from the recycling bin even if that is not what you meant to do Life is full of hazards Disease enemies and starvation are always menacing primitive man Experience teaches him that medicinal herbs valor the most strenuous labor often come to naught yet normally he wants to survive and enjoy the good things of existence Faced with this problem he takes to any method that seems adapted to his ends Often his ways appear incredibly crude to us moderns until we remember how our next door neighbor acts in like emergencies When medical science pronounces him curable he will not resign himself to fate but runs to the nearest quack who holds out hope of recovery His urge for self preservation will not down nor will that of the illiterate peoples of the world and in that overpowering will to live is anchored the belief in supernaturalism which is absolutely universal among known peoples past and present I grew up in a small town in northern California between wide open ranchland and dark forests feeling at home in two places the wild land and books I read constantly hungrily and without direction collecting a strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the world I longed for a world away from what I knew and outrageously outside my means One morning I came across a catalog for a college preparatory school called Billups Academy It had a summer program and offered scholarships for high school students to deepen and extend their intellectual aesthetic and moral interests I applied for and won a scholarship Billups wasn t just another school it was another world I was used to big skies wild water snakes and horses and solitude What waited for me in this new world was tree lined avenues brick buildings with white pillars and a wood paneled library Unlike back at home in the new school I was no longer the smartest kid in the classroom I wasn t the most talented or the least Before going to Billups one of my dreams was to become a photographer That dream came to an abrupt halt in a photography class There was no denying in the other students pictures that they were far more talented than I was I became severely depressed as one dream after another faded from me Then on the last night of the summer program it hit me I had been blind to a lesson that was staring at me in the face The important lesson I learned at Billups the world was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be was a little painful It meant I was a lot smaller than I d realized I went on to attend a state university and I began to write about my disappearing dreams and new dreams about wishing and disappointment and feeling small One day a professor there took hold of me and said You re a writer Until then I hadn t really known I had to figure out who I was not going to be before I could get on to who I was The lesson from Billups lay below the surface but when I began to write it rose like flowers and bloomed into words and stories and books and me There was a girl who grew flowers in New Jersey and sometimes took flowers to customers on Staten Island To get there she had to go over a bridge paying a toll of One day as she was approaching the toll booth she saw a toll booth attendant who reminded her of her mother As she reached in her pocket she found she had no money but a half dollar Not knowing what to do she handed the coin to her and asked nervously Want to buy a fresh red rose The attendant looked surprised at first but glancing at the cars piling up behind her she took two dollars from her purse and rang it up on the cash register Yes I ll take it she said with a smile And I suppose the price is two dollars even right The phrase jack of all trades is a shortened version of jack of all trades and master of none It refers to those who claim to be proficient at countless tasks but cannot perform a single one of them well The phrase was first used in England at the start of the Industrial Revolution A large number of efficiency experts set up shop in London advertising themselves as knowledgeable about every type of new manufacturing process trade and business For a substantial fee they would impart their knowledge to their clients But it soon became evident that their knowledge was limited and of no practical value Doubtful industrialists started calling these self appointed experts jacks of all trades and masters of none These experts are still with us and as a result so does the phrase Mr Potter was sailing for Europe on one of the greatest transatlantic ocean liners When he went on board he found another passenger was to share the cabin with him After going to see the accommodations he came up to the purser s desk and inquired if he could leave his valuables in the ship s safe Mr Potter explained that ordinarily he never availed himself of that privilege but he had been to his cabin and had met the man who was to occupy the other bed Judging from his appearance he was afraid that he might not be a very trustworthy person The purser accepted the responsibility for the valuables and remarked It s all right I ll be very glad to take care of them for you The other man has been up here and left his valuables for the same reason When it comes to food choices young people are particularly vulnerable to peer influences A teenage girl may eat nothing but a lettuce salad for lunch even though she will become hungry later because that is what her friends are eating A slim boy who hopes to make the wrestling team may routinely overload his plate with foods that are dense in carbohydrates and proteins to bulk up like the wrestlers of his school An overweight teen may eat moderately while around his friends but then devour huge portions when alone Few young people are completely free of food related pressures from peers whether or not these pressures are imposed intentionally It is said that although people laugh in the same way they don t necessarily laugh at the same things If this is true of a single community it is even more true of people who live in different societies because the topics that people find amusing and the occasions that are regarded as appropriate for joking can vary enormously from one society to the next Some styles of humor with silly actions are guaranteed to raise a laugh everywhere But because of their reliance on shared assumptions most jokes travel very well This is particularly noticeable in the case of jokes that involve a play on words They are difficult and in some cases virtually impossible to translate into other languages Therefore this is why people s attempts to tell jokes to foreigners are so often met with blank stares For a year Danny had trained hard to master the famous Pikes Peak Marathon But when running the actual marathon he was feeling weary and tired In a narrow path through the woods he got stuck behind a slow weak runner wearing a T shirt with Bob s written on the back He felt even more tired because he had to lag behind the fellow As he was finally overtaking the runner out of curiosity he asked him What s Bob s My friend Bob had a dream to run this marathon four times he answered He ran it three times but then last year he died So I decided to complete his dream for him This is Bob s Suddenly all the exhaustion he had been feeling during the race disappeared No matter what we are shopping for it is not primarily a brand we are choosing but a culture or rather the people associated with that culture Whether you wear torn jeans or like to recite poetry by doing so you make a statement of belonging to a group of people Who we believe we are is a result of the choices we make about who we want to be like and we subsequently demonstrate this desired likeness to others in various and often subtle ways Artificial as this process is this is what becomes our identity an identity grounded on all the superficial differences we distinguish between ourselves and others This after all is what we are shopping for self identity knowledge of who we are Almost every day I play a game with myself that I call time machine I made it up in response to my erroneous belief that what I was all worked up about was really important To play time machine all you have to do is to imagine that whatever circumstance you are dealing with is not happening right now but a year from now It might be an argument with your spouse a mistake or a lost opportunity but it is highly likely that a year from now you are not going to care It will be one more irrelevant detail in your life While this simple game will not solve every your problems it can give you an enormous amount of needed perspective I find myself laughing at things that I used to take far too seriously Efficiency means producing a specific end rapidly with the least amount of cost The idea of efficiency is specific to the interests of the industry or business but is typically advertised as a benefit to the customer Examples are plentiful the salad bars filling your own cup self service gasoline ATMs microwave dinners and convenience stores which are different from the old time groceries where you gave your order to the grocer The interesting element here is that the customer often ends up doing the work that previously was done for them And the customer ends up spending more time and being forced to learn new technologies remember more numbers and often pay higher prices in order for the business to operate more efficiently or maintain a higher profit margin The three pictures above represent a model of the effects of global warming on permafrost regions Permafrost is frozen ground that remains at or below for more than two years Most of the world s permafrost has been frozen for millennia trapping massive amounts of carbon in organic material In areas of extreme cold presented in Picture permafrost is thousands of feet thick and lies below a layer of soil a few feet deep called the active layer which freezes and thaws with the seasons Where the average annual air temperature is slightly below freezing permafrost is scattered as in Picture Compared to Picture the permafrost in Picture is topped by a shallower active layer In Picture in permafrost regions that now experience shorter milder winters the area of permafrost is reduced further compared to Picture Carbon dioxide and methane are freed into the atmosphere and more trees and plants grow as in Picture Kameron once worked hard for several weeks building a wall made of railroad ties in his backyard When he was almost finished his neighbor Mr Brown regretfully asked him if he could please take out the railroad ties and use rocks instead He simply explained that his wife did not want to look at a railroad tie wall for the rest of her life Kameron could not believe the nerve of this neighbor to ask such a thing when he had almost finished the wall Although he did not fully understand his reasoning he knew the Browns would be his neighbors for a long time Although it cost him another week of extra work he did what the neighbors requested and replaced the ties with rocks If you need to buy food there is probably a shop or a department store close to your home that sells just what you want But shopping has not always been so easy Shops started only with the introduction of money In earlier times people traded crops or objects they had made in exchange for the goods they needed The first shops sold just a few products such as meat and bread In the first department store a shop which sells many different items under one roof opened in Paris Self service stores developed in the United States in the s They replaced the old methods of serving customers individually by selling sold prepackaged goods straight from the shelves Chocolate can last in a cool dry place for up to a year When the temperature in your cupboard averages above degrees Fahrenheit chocolate may quickly develop thin white layers caused by the separation of cocoa butter You can still eat this chocolate even though it should not be used for decorations as it tends to break easily Though chocolate may be kept in the refrigerator or freezer it will take on the smells of other foods in time so taste before using Also making sure to bring chocolate to room temperature before eating as frozen bits of chocolate always strike me as rather hard and tasteless It is surprising just how tolerant some cats and kittens can be with babies and young children but this is not something you should put to the test You must teach children not to disturb the cat especially by grabbing at him when he is resting in his bed Discourage young children from picking up kittens and cats because they may squeeze them too hard around the belly and make them hate being carried for life Instead encourage the cat to climb on the child s lap and remain there to be petted Show children how to stroke the cat and how to pick him up and carry him The cat should never be held down during these encounters be sure that the child understands that he or she must allow the cat to walk away whenever he wishes The above flower spreads out into a circle when you look straight into its face The buttonlike structure sitting right in the middle of the flower is actually formed from many tiny flowers called disk flowers The disk flowers include petals which are actually individual flowers called ray flowers The ray flowers radiate out from the rim of the disk flowers and reach to the edge of the whole flower You can draw the flower easily with the following procedure First draw two dotted lines that will quarter the flower imagining its shape This enables you to draw the ray flowers correctly and keep track of where you are Next draw two circle guidelines The inner one indicates the outline of the disk flowers and the outer one the extent of the ray flowers Then fill the inner circle with disk flowers and the outer one with ray flowers When it comes to talking I have observed two basic personality types The first I call the Dead Sea People with this personality type have many experiences emotions and thoughts throughout the day They have a large reservoir where they store that information and they are perfectly happy not to talk On the other extreme is the Babbling Brook For this personality whatever enters into the eye gate or the ear gate comes out the mouth gate Many times a Dead Sea marries a Babbling Brook That happens because when they are dating it is a very attractive match If you are a Dead Sea and you date a Babbling Brook you will have a wonderful evening You do not have to think How will I get the conversation started tonight How will I keep the conversation flowing In fact you do not have to think at all All you have to do is nod your head and say Uh huh and she will fill up the whole evening and you will go home saying What a wonderful person On the other hand if you are a Babbling Brook and you date a Dead Sea you will have an equally wonderful evening because Dead Seas are the world s best listeners You will talk continuously for three hours He will listen intently to you and you will go home saying What a wonderful person You attract each other But five years after marriage the Babbling Brook wakes up one morning and says We ve been married five years and I don t know you The Dead Sea is saying I know you too well I wish you would stop the flow and give me a break The good news is that Dead Seas can learn to talk and Babbling Brooks can learn to listen We are influenced by our personality but not controlled by it Whether woven or printed a fine tie is a work of art from beginning to end Woven s ilk ties are the most luxurious of all Though less common today they were at one time the essential accessory of a true gentleman Because of their high manufacturing cost woven silk ties are very expensive This in part accounts for the fact that they now represent only five percent of tie production But they will never fall entirely by the wayside and will make periodic comebacks Printed silk ties are much cheaper and simpler than their woven counterparts However silk printing demands a high level of technical mastery I had twenty village girls to teach some of them with such a strong country accent that I could hardly communicate with them Only three could read and none could write so at the end of my first day I felt quite depressed at the thought of the hard work ahead of me But I reminded myself that I was fortunate to have any sort of job and that I would certainly get used to teaching these girls who although they were very poor might be as good and as intelligent as children from the greatest families in England The bodies of flowing ice we call glaciers are the most spectacular of natural features They result from densely packed snow Unlike a stream a glacier cannot be seen move Accurate measurements however show that it is flowing Erosion of bedrock by glaciers and deposits of the eroded materials are characteristic and easily recognizable Their distribution enables us to infer that in the recent past glaciers have been far more extens ive than they are today At the same time this evidence has raised the problem of the cause of the ice ages The day of the whale is rapidly approaching its end Some species of whales are already extinct Others are being reduced in number faster than they can reproduce When whales are gone the whole chain of life in the sea as we know it will be upset And eventually this will have a direct effect on the life of man too Although there are international agreements signed by some governments people are killing whales without cons idering what future consequences this will have Let s save whales friends of the earth When a ballet dancer leaps across the stage in a grand jump her center of mass faithfully follows a parabolic path during the jump The distance between the top of her head and her center of mass changes depending upon the movements of her legs When she stretches her legs out horizontally after her feet leave the stage her center of mass moves upward It results in an increase in the dis tance between the top of her head and her center of mass In contrast when the dancer lowers her legs toward the ground the opposite occurs The height of the top of her head remains constant throughout the jump The result gives the impression that the dancer is drifting through the air Mel a chimpanzee in Gombe Nigeria was three years old when his mother died He had no elder brother or sister to adopt him To our amazement he was adopted by a twelve year old chimpanzee Spindle who was certainly not related to Mel As weeks passed the two became inseparable Spindle took care of Mel while traveling he permitted the infant to ride on his back even allowed him to hang beneath as a mother carries her baby Most remarkably if Mel got too close to the big males Spindle would hurry to remove his small charge from danger even though this meant he got into trouble himself For a whole year this relationship endured and there was no doubt that Spindle saved Mel s life Why did Spindle act that way burdening himself with the care of a sickly youngster Probably we shall never know but it is interesting to reflect that during the plague that claimed Mel s mother Spindle s mother also died Is it possible that Spindle s loss of his mother left an empty space in his life And that the contact with a dependent baby helped to fill that space Or did Spindle experience an emotion similar to that which we call revenge Perhaps the lonely chimpanzee felt a mixture of both Our basic nature is to act and not to be acted upon Not only does this enable us to choose our response to particular circumstances but this encourages us to create circumstances Taking the initiative means recognizing our responsibility to make things happen Over the years I have frequently counseled people who wanted better jobs to show more initiative The response is usually agreement Most people can see how powerfully such an approach would affect their opportunities for employment or advancement We have long known about IQ and rational intelligence And in part because of recent advances in neuroscience and psychology we have begun to appreciate the importance of emotional intelligence But we are largely ignorant of that there is such a thing as visual intelligence Vision is normally so swift and sure so dependable and informative and apparently so effortless that we take it for granted The traditionally trained painters who were previously confined mostly to exact copy of natural objects enjoyed an important outlet impressionist art at the end of the nineteenth century Especially many French painters produced enormous quantities of impressionistic art inspired by the characteristic images of natural objects These works reflected the major themes of the times such as love and nature and the new techniques of painting intensified and illuminated those themes Most impressionist painters contributed to the new movement of fine art Manet s output was particularly excellent in capturing the changes of sunlight There are millions of people who require different lenses to see near and faraway objects They use bifocals which are very tiring to wear Now a practical alternative is on the horizon A group of researchers have created an experimental model of a pair of electronic eyeglasses that can refocus automatically As illustrated above they are equipped with a small battery With a flip of a switch the battery sends electricity to patterned electrodes coated on the lens Then the molecules in the liquid crystal layer sandwiched between the two lenses rotate altering the way they bend light In less than a second the lens distorts focus There was a man who had four sons He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly So he sent them each on a quest in turn to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away The first son he sent in the winter the second in the spring the third in the summer and the youngest son in the fall When they had all gone and come back he called them together to describe what they had seen The first son said that the tree was ugly bent and twisted The second son said it was covered with green buds and full of promise The third son disagreed he said it was filled with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful The last son disagreed with all of them he said it was ripe and bending with fruit full of life and fulfillment The man then explained to his sons that they were all right because they had each seen only one season in the tree s life He said You should not judge a tree by only one season The same is true of people s lives A person s life can only be measured at the end when all the seasons are up Therefore sons don t give up when it s winter If you do you will miss the promise of your spring the beauty of your summer and the fulfillment of your fall It was World War I just after the outbreak of hostilities The two captains of the luxurious and gigantic pass enger ships the British ocean liner Carmania and the German liner Cap Trafalgar were both ordered to convert their vess els into armed merchant cruisers Because either would have been an easy victim of a determined enemy disguise was essential By coincidence each captain decided to disguise his ship as the other By an even greater coincidence they met in the South Atlantic The outcome

for identification purposes as there are specific treatments for different plant poisons One of the most common barriers to effective learning is that people do not pay attention to s ituations in which new information is presented Think about what your father or mother wore to work this morning Can you remember what tie he had on Which blouse she wore What color your brother s T shirt was By actively looking and making a conscious effort to take in this type of information trivial as it may seem you begin to train your brain to log in details By engaging in this type of observation process we can absorb details and meaning from a new face event or conversation which helps us to remember it When we have little interest in something it is often difficult to remember because we are not paying full attention Many of us forget names s econds after being introduced to someone new We need to slow down just enough to notice what is being said and decide whether it is important or not Samuel Johnson s imply puts it this way The true art of memory is the art of attention Memory for street directions is an excellent example If you drive yourself to a new place by following directions you ll probably remember how to get there days or even weeks later If you are merely a passenger on your first trip you are likely to get lost on your firs t solo trip The goal in active observation is to mentally stay in the driver s seat Robin Hood and his men have been described as a band of successful robbers However to me they were great adventurers band thin flat strip used for fastening

Cabbage White is Yes I learned about it in biology class It s a beautiful white butterfly Olivia answered Right But it lays its eggs on cabbages and then the caterpillars eat the cabbage leaves So why don t you help me to pick the caterpillars up Grandma suggested The two sisters gladly agreed and went back to the house to get ready Soon armed with a small bucket each Olivia and Ellie went back to Grandma When they saw the cabbage patch they suddenly remembered how vast it was There seemed to be a million cabbages Olivia stood open mouthed at the sight of the endless cabbage field She thought they could not possibly pick all of the caterpillars off Olivia sighed in despair Grandma smiled at her and said Don t worry We are only working on this first row here today Relieved she and Ellie started on the first cabbage The caterpillars wriggled as they were picked up while Cabbage Whites filled the air around them It was as if the butterflies were making fun of Olivia they seemed to be laughing at her suggesting that they would lay millions more eggs The cabbage patch looked like a battlefield Olivia felt like she was losing the battle but she fought on She kept filling her bucket with the caterpillars until the bottom disappeared Feeling exhausted and discouraged she asked Grandma Why don t we just get rid of all the butterflies so that there will be no more eggs or caterpillars The above graph shows the sales of four types of ethical produce in the UK in and In the sales of each of the four types of ethical produce showed an increase from the sales of its

in wool silk and other merchandise His career however especially early on knew the vicissitudes characteristic of Renaissance business For example while he was en route to Spain as his enterprise s traveling partner a role typical for young men pirates robbed him of all his goods including a consignment of pearls and of his own clothes His recovery from such losses followed in part from four successive marriages Later in life he was honored to serve a number of posts in the city government Over the years he wrote a diary actually an occasional record in which he kept accounts of his commercial and family life Men of his kind pioneered this form of writing about the public and private self The Great Salt Lake is the largest salt lake in the Western Hemisphere The lake is fed by the Bear Weber and Jordan rivers and has no outlet At the close of the Ice Age the entire region was submerged beneath a lake of meltwater and overflow from the lake flowed into the Pacific Ocean through the Snake and Columbia rivers The great climatic change the lake underwent and continued evaporation exceeding the inflow of fresh water reduced the lake to one twentieth of its former size The majority of salt in the Great Salt Lake is a remnant of dissolved salts that are present in all fresh water As the water evaporated the traces of dissolved salts were gradually concentrated in the shrinking lake The graphs above show the percentage of world electricity generation by sources of energy for and According to the graphs the primary source of electricity generation in both and was coal and peat accounting for over of the total electricity generation Oil showed the biggest decrease in electricity generation which fell from in to in The source that showed the biggest increase was nuclear which rose from in to in In hydro was the second biggest source of electricity generation but in gas was the second biggest accounting for more than of the total electricity generation Besides coal and peat hydro was the only source that accounted for more than of the total electricity generation in both and Marking the Nepal Tibet border Everest looms as a three sided pyramid of gleaming ice and dark rock The first eight expeditions to Everest were British all of which attempted the mountain from the northern Tibetan side not because it presented the most obvious weakness in the peak s formidable defenses but because in the Tibetan government opened its borders to foreigners while Nepal remained off limits The first Everesters were obliged to trek miles from Darjeeling across the Tibetan plateau to reach the foot of the mountain Their knowledge of the deadly effects of extreme altitude was limited and their equipment was poor Yet in a member of the third British expedition Edward Felix Norton reached an elevation of feet just feet below the summit before being defeated by exhaustion and snow blindness It was an astounding achievement that was not surpassed for years Giorgio Vasari the Italian painter architect and writer was born in Arezzo in He was considered to be more successful as an architect than a painter But what made him truly famous was his book Lives of the Most Eminent Painters Sculptors and Architects shortened as Lives It is not known exactly how many copies of the first edition of Lives published in were printed but it earned Vasari the praise of his peers Then in a revised edition of Lives in complete with portraits of the artists he combined biographical anecdotes with critical comment Although the revised edition overshadowed Vasari s own achievements as a painter and architect it made him the most respected man of the Italian art world He was even knighted by Pope Pius in When I was a freshman in high school I won second prize in our local newspaper s essay contest on the theme of future career I wrote about wanting to become a journalist We had to collect our prizes at the local variety store and while waiting in line a little notebook in the stationery department caught my eye It was a black and red hardcover book with the word Record neatly engraved in gold on the cover I reasoned that since I was going to be a journalist I d need a very special notebook in which to write So I bought it But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about it and about becoming a journalist Painting became my great love Upon graduating from high school I went to college as a fine art major and English minor After becoming a professional artist marriage followed then the birth of two daughters A career change came next which led to teaching underprivileged young children in Los Angeles The years passed Then during a serious illness when I was thirty five I found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years earlier From my sick bed I noticed it on a nearby shelf It was still blank but something told me to write my deepest feelings and thoughts my pain and fear my wishes and dreams the words of my inner world This was my first official journal And the process of journal keeping through writing and drawing helped heal me from a mysterious illness which had defied the doctors and their medicines My life changed so much after that I began listening to my own feelings and inner wisdom The insights I gained through journal keeping led me into a new career as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing More importantly I learned to play and enjoy life again For instance several years after recovering from my illness I started skateboarding for the first time in my life and loved it I m grateful to that high school girl that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank book I used it to save my life and to help others Around B C there lived in Greece a very famous painter named Apelles It was his practice to conceal himself at previews of his paintings in order to hear the public s opinions of his masterpieces At one such preview a bootmaker criticized the shoes in a painting on which Apelles had labored long and hard After correcting the picture the painter arranged a second preview This time the bootmaker began to criticize the anatomy of one of the characters Apelles was unable to restrain himself for he knew that the criticism was unjust and the man knew nothing about anatomy From his hiding place Apelles shouted Bootmaker stick to your last From that time it has been the custom to ridicule the people who act like they know what they do not with the pointed caution Stick to your last Bristlecone pines are unusual trees that grow in the mountain regions of western America sometimes as high as two or more miles above sea level They grow very slowly and range from to feet in height These evergreens often live for thousands of years Considering the habitat of these trees such as rocky areas where the soil is poor and precipitation is slight it seems almost incredible that they should live so long or even survive at all The environmental adversities however actually contribute to their longevity Cells that are produced as a result of these conditions are densely arranged The densely structured wood is resistant to invasion by insects and other potential pests Bristlecone pines grow faster in richer conditions but die earlier and soon decay The harshness of their surroundings then is a vital factor in making them strong and sturdy The above graph shows the percentage of children from birth to years of age by gender diagnosed with asthma in rural and urban areas in Canada for the and periods For both rural and urban areas the percentages of male children diagnosed with asthma were higher than those of female children for all the periods During all the periods the percentages of male children with asthma were higher in urban areas than in rural areas Regarding female children with asthma the lowest percentage in urban areas was greater than the highest percentage in rural areas In urban areas the percentage of male children with asthma in the period was lower than that of male children with asthma in the period In rural areas the percentages of female children with asthma were the same in the period and the period After several futile attempts to teach the role of theme or the prominent repeated melody in classical music the teacher was at wit s end Having reminded her students many times that composers like Wagner depended on the listeners remembering the earlier theme to recognize its later use she was determined to make her students understand that themes recur throughout a piece She knew that her class had little trouble with simple variations and could easily identify themes that were repeated in a similar way But when the theme showed much variation the students attention focused on the new detail to such an extent that they no longer heard the basic theme For a week or two the teacher worried about the problem Other teachers advised her to go on with something else but she continued to search for a solution With this problem in mind one afternoon during the lunch hour she noticed a group of students gathered in a corner of the school yard Several girls were moving their bodies rhythmically Curious she drew closer and found that the students were listening to a new rock hit A girl in the center of the group held a tape recorder in her hand At that moment a sudden inspiration took hold The following day in class she asked how many students had tape recorders A dozen or so students said I do The teacher said excitedly I have an idea Let s play Beethoven s Eroica again One of you can record the theme when it s first introduced Then later someone else can record it the second time it appears Finally we ll have another person record when it appears next Then we can start all three tape recorders at exactly the same time to see if the recordings fit Her students looked at her in surprise Suddenly however delight appeared on their faces And so it was done When they played the recordings simultaneously the sounds blended sufficiently for the students to recognize their commonality The graph above shows the growth rate of total output in the U S from to The growth rate of total output is equal to the growth rate in the number of hours worked plus the growth rate of labor productivity The period displayed the highest growth rate of total output of all the periods in the graph The growth rate of total output declined from the period to the period The only period where the growth rate in the number of hours worked exceeded the labor productivity growth rate was the period The period showed an increase in the growth rate of total output from the period The period displayed the second highest growth rate of total output and the greatest labor productivity growth rate of all the time periods Like its largemouth cousin the smallmouth bass is a native of the Mississippi drainage which makes it a true heartland fish Whereas the largemouth likes slow or still water with lots of food holding weeds the smallmouth prefers clean rocky bottoms and swifter water ideally in the range of to F In waters warmer than F you can forget about finding one In lakes smallmouth often school up which means that if you catch one you can catch a bunch In rivers and streams they are more solitary The smallmouth has a series of dark vertical bands along its sides The dorsal fin is one continuous fin as opposed to the separated dorsal fin of the largemouth Starting in the s people began flooding into Chattanooga a former factory town to explore its caves rivers and cliffs Before long more than caves surrounding the city had been discovered The nearby Ocoee was among the most paddled rivers in the country and six major climbing sites sprang up within an hour s drive of city limits But in spite of this boundless outdoors potential there remained the problem of Chattanooga proper a post industrial wasteland that made the city the kind of place you would visit but would never want to live in Not that is until lately Over the past decade Chattanooga has made an incredible urban comeback electric buses organic markets and a million dollar riverfront restoration project completed last year In addition beautiful modern architecture such as the post modern museum and the newly remodeled aquarium plays a big role in the comeback of Chattanooga The above graph shows changes in school enrollment rates of the population ages by age group from to The enrollment rates of all age groups were higher than percent in Of all age groups

covered rooftop hangar of his house The journey itself would be of use There were times when it was important to be alone to have time to think Alone even from one s personal robot from one s trusted wife Captain Koppe sensed that this was one of those times when he had to be alone if for no other reason than to remind himself that he would have to make his decision alone And he would have the duration of the flight all to himself The thought appealed to him as he powered up the aircar and it lifted a half meter or so off the deck of the hangar The outer doors opened and the aircar slowly eased out into the driving rain Suddenly it was in the middle of the storm jumping and swinging in the darkness the rain crashing down on the windows with incredible violence The storm boomed and roared outside the long range aircar as it fought for altitude the banging and clattering getting worse with every moment Smooth sailing after the storm the aircar arrived at the orbit of the Island of Paradise Captain Koppe looked out at the Island through the window He had been longing for it since his childhood At that moment his family picture posted on the inside of the aircar came into his eyes All of a sudden he had an irresistible urge to go to see his beloved wife and his two sons He turned his back on the Island of Paradise and directed it toward the homeland Dominique Jean Larrey

improvements made by a company from to The left bar chart shows the costs of carrying them out and the right bar chart shows the resulting savings during the same period The company reduced its water use by installing automatic faucets and water saving toilets saving dollars The greatest saving came from the installation of energy saving lights Timed shut offs of electricity came second in savings These two improvements cost much less than the other measures The most expensive installation was that of smart escalators Although the installation costs differed all the improvements resulted in savings for the company Margo was on holiday with friends three miles off the Kenyan coast in the Indian Ocean in a fishing boat Suddenly the engine died and for mysterious reasons the boat began to sink Before they knew what was happening Margo her three friends and d the African boatman were in the sea They all had life jackets but it was a long way to shore Around them were lots of wooden barrels and boards At that moment e one of the three friends said I don t know how to swim Margo took charge She shouted out orders She told each person to take a wooden board use it as a float and begin kicking slowly toward shore She ordered b the non swimmer to share a piece of board with her Kick softly she told him Don t stir up the water more than you have to With Margo s firm presence next to him the non swimmer avoided panic When every now and then his kicking became awkward and noisy Margo ordered c him to stop Slowly and quietly the five moved toward the distant shore They all reached the beach two hours later exhausted but safe At that time the non swimmer thanked Margo for saving his life and a he asked why she had been so insistent about going slowly and quietly Because she said to him for one thing I knew it was a long way and we had to conserve our energy For another that ocean is full of sharks and I didn t care to attract their attention But if I d told you that you might have panicked and none of us would have made it For centuries sundials and water clocks inaccurately told us all we needed to know about time Mechanical clocks started appearing on towers in Italy in the th century but their timekeeping was less impressive than their looks wandering up to minutes a day By the th century some geniuses including Galileo and Pascal had theorized about but failed to build better timepieces Then in Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens constructed the first pendulum clock revolutionizing timekeeping The precision of Huygens clock allowed scientists to use it for their physics experiments and shopkeepers to open and close at fixed hours In Englishman John Harrison perfected a clock that worked at sea and put accurate time in a navigator s pocket Fueled by a lifelong love of literature Gonzales has devoted himself to providing people with more access to literature When he moved to Marysville Kansas after a successful career as a barber in Los Angeles

read books they had nowhere to turn said Gonzales His efforts came to be recognized nationwide and he won the Livingstone Award in Mr Gonzales has helped people find a shelter for their spirits wrote the Livingstone Committee I was eight years old At that moment in my life nothing was more important to me than baseball My team was the New York Giants and I followed the doings of those men in the black and orange caps with all the devotion of a true believer Even now remembering that team which no longer exists I can recite the names of nearly every baseball player on the team But none was greater and none more perfect than Willie Mays That spring I was taken to my first big league game Just as we approached the exit after the game I caught sight of Willie Mays He was standing near the gate not ten feet away from me I rushed to him and said Mr Mays could I please have your autograph He said Sure kid You got a pencil I didn t have one in my pocket The great Willie Mays stood there watching in silence He just shrugged and said Sorry kid And then he walked out of the ballpark into the night I didn t want to cry but tears started falling down my cheeks and there was nothing I could do to stop them After that night I started carrying a pencil with me wherever I went It became a habit of mine never to leave the house without making sure I had a pencil in my pocket It s not that I had any particular plans for that pencil but I didn t want to be unprepared I had been caught empty handed once and I wasn t about to let it happen again If nothing else the years have taught me this If there s a pencil in your pocket there s a good chance that one day you ll feel tempted to start using it Never in good health as a child Anita lost her hearing at ten Her father s business

she was ten weeks old and Rita immediately bonded with her petting her feeding her teaching her basic commands and letting her sleep on Rita s bed The two were always together and within arm s reach The only time they were apart was when Rita was learning to swim Princess had a fear of water that was so extreme that she couldn t even touch the water Princess fears stemmed from her puppyhood when she almost drowned twice These early traumas made water the only thing that Princess truly feared When she came close to a body of water she would try to pull back and seemed emotionally distressed Would she ever be able to overcome this fear She had a chance one late afternoon when Rita s mother took them to a shopping mall It was located along the edge of a lake and featured a wooden boardwalk which was built along the shore While her mother headed to a store Rita and Princess began to play on the boardwalk Suddenly a boy riding a bicycle slipped on the damp wooden surface hitting Rita at an angle which propelled her through an open section of the guard rail She let out a scream of pain and fear as she fell into the water She then continued to cry for help and struggle to get out Upon hearing Rita s cry her mother rushed to the railing shouting for help from the entrance of the store a hundred feet or so away Princess was looking at the water and trembling in fear She stood there staring at the water the one thing that had nearly taken her life Her love for Rita overpowered her fear and she leapt out through the same open space in the railing and plunged into the water Once in the water Princess quickly found Rita and slowly dragged her to the shore to her grateful mother The above graph shows direct expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP for the five OECD

Chicago As a kid I had visions of being a hero a police officer or an astronaut However people would always tell me You can t do that You aren t smart enough You aren t strong enough Moreover d I didn t do well in school and I had no hope of getting into any college After high school I gave up on my dream of going to college and got a part time job instead I felt like I was living in a box labeled

of the professors offices and said Please tell me how to get in here The professor could see that I was determined He said I can t let you in the university but e I will see you whenever you need my advice or help It took me a long time but I eventually got into that university became a football player and graduated The above graph shows the comparison between the allocated budget and actual

Now being built in England it is expected to be completed within a year Powered by three engines it is designed to go miles per hour mph which would blast past the current land speed record of mph set in It is meters long meters wide and meters tall and weighs tons Due to its enormous weight it won t be the quickest car in the world from to mph as it will take seconds But after that it will only take seconds to go from to mph The Bloodhound Car is scheduled to make its record breaking attempt in at the Hakskeen Pan Desert in South Africa The graph above shows the percentage of population growth and forest loss in the continents of the world since Africa shows the highest percentage of population growth whereas Europe shows the lowest percentage of population growth Africa also shows the highest percentage of forest loss followed by Latin America Oceania Asia and North America The only continent that exhibits a negative percentage in forest loss which translates to forest gain is Europe A point of note is that while Asia and Oceania have similar percentages of population growth Oceania displays less forest loss than Asia Overall there are only two continents whose percentage of forest loss is greater than five percent Known as the Golden City Jaisalmer a former caravan center on the route to the Khyber Pass rises from a sea of sand its foot high walls and medieval

here that it is easy to imagine yourself back in the th century It is the only fortress city in India still functioning with one quarter of its population living within the walls It is just far enough off the beaten path to have been spared damage from tourists The city s wealth originally came from the substantial tolls it placed on passing merchants The best known female artist of the sixteenth century Sofonisba Anguissola was born into a noble Italian family Her mother died young leaving her wealthy husband with five talented daughters Unusual of the time this liberal father gave his daughters a full classical education including painting It was this enlightened attitude that enabled Anguissola to earn her own living as a portrait painter in the Spanish court and helped her to rise above the restrictions of her class and gender In Three Sisters Playing Chess Anguissola broke with tradition by concentrating on those scenes and models available to her painting her sisters in a domestic setting This gave the portrait an immediacy which allowed the contemporary Italian art historian Vasari to attribute to her the development of the conversational portrait as opposed to the formal frontal or profile portrait The above table shows the differences in technology product use on a weekly basis among grade groups of students and teachers in the U S As the students go up in

public libraries and hospitals around the world From these toy libraries parents and children could borrow toys knowing that they have been thoroughly tried and tested not only for their play value but also for safety Over the years the association has involved leading professional educators and therapists alongside parents in the production of numerous publications on specific toys and aspects of play In its early years the association was opposed by the toy industry because it was likely to reduce sales of toys as children were borrowing them The above chart shows the economic advantage of transgenic cotton farming over conventional farming in four countries in In all the countries the seed cost for the transgenic crop was higher than that for the conventional one However lower pesticide costs higher yields and higher revenues made the transgenic crop more profitable The profit ratio varied from country to country In Argentina the ratio of the transgenic seed cost to the cost of the conventional one was higher than that of the other countries In South Africa the profit ratio of the transgenic crop to the conventional one was the highest followed by China Among the nations Mexico s crop produced the lowest ratios in yield and profit as compared to the conventional one Some people think the languages of so called primitive peoples are so simple that they have

enabled farmers to rescue crops which otherwise might have been lost The combine was first developed for use in countries where the climate was suitable for grain production It was said that the climate in such countries as the British Isles was totally unsuitable for its use However this was not true Combines work in quite damp conditions The use of a combine resulted in a big reduction in the time and labor required to harvest a given crop because only one or at the most two men were needed to operate the machine Other labor required to transport the grain to storage was not excessive

Christmas a He also said Lennie someday you ll have a pony of your own However some day is a pain to a boy who lives in and knows only now Meanwhile my father took me to a pony fair and let me try some ponies but b he always found some fault with them leaving me in despair When Christmas was at hand I had abandoned all hope of getting one Instead I hung up the biggest stocking I had Waking up at a m my little sisters and I raced for the fireplace downstairs While my sisters were delighted to find their stockings filled with presents mine was empty I went out into the yard and wept all by myself After an hour my frustration reached its climax when I saw a man riding a pony with a brand new saddle When he looked at our door he just passed by which caused me to break into a flood of tears Then he said Kid do you know a boy named Lennie Steffens That s me I replied in tears He said I ve been looking all over for your house Why don t you put your house number where it can be seen He went on saying I should have been here at Your father told me to bring the pony here and leave c him for you I d never seen anything so beautiful as my pony And finally I rode off into the fields Thrilled by riding I began to feast my eyes on the world around me The trees seemed to be taking on smiling faces and the birds seemed to be singing to congratulate me on getting my new friend When I returned home my father asked Why did you come back so soon With a smile on my face I answered d him I didn t want to make him feel tired It s his first day with me e He laughed and wiped away the tear stains from my face his heartfelt gesture of apology for such a long delayed present Bursting with happiness I spent the rest of the day brushing my pony in the stable The above graph shows the

it Spineless and flat against the ground it has triangular tubercles that overlap in a star shaped pattern In extremely dry conditions living rock cactus is almost invisible it literally shrinks into the surrounding rocky soil Moisture is stored in the root and during droughts the root shrinks dragging the stem underground These spineless plants survive by blending into their native habitat As added protection they store foul tasting poisonous alkaloids in their bodies Jim Nelson a junior at Manti High School was an outstanding athlete He had just made the school basketball team one of the

especially for her investigations of pre Columbian culture and her studies of Mexican peoples and native Mexican plants Nuttall was a brilliant archival researcher and self trained archaeologist who very early carved a career for herself by pursuing independent research and publishing in scholarly journals Before age she became a member of several highly prestigious scientific societies on the basis of her work She was the winner of three medals for the exhibits of the results of her archival work and archaeological research which she presented in Europe and the United States Nuttall was never a part of university teaching faculty and indeed there is no indication that she would have accepted such a position had it been offered Early in her career she was appointed Honorary Assistant in Mexican Archaeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University a post she held for forty seven years To be creative problem solvers people must learn to approach complexity with a certain naive simplicity And by letting their thinking become more free they can improve their chances of discovering new unencumbered perceptions of old problems or entirely new creations For this they can mentally play with the ideas in a childlike manner Here is an example story In a small Moravian village at the time of the old Austrian empire an inspector from the Ministry of Education arrived one day to visit the schoolroom It was part of a his duty to make such periodic inspections of the schools At the end of the hour after he had observed the class he stood up and said I am glad to see that you children are doing well in your studies I am satisfied with your progress Therefore before I go there is one question I would like to ask How many hairs does a horse have Very quickly one little nine year old boy raised his hand to the astonishment of the teacher and the visitor b He stood up and said The horse has hairs The inspector wonderingly asked And how do you know that this is the right number The boy replied If you do not believe me you could count them yourself The inspector broke into loud laughter thoroughly enjoying the boy s remark As the teacher escorted d him along the aisle to the door still laughing heartily he said What an amusing story I must tell this story to my colleagues when I return to Vienna I can already see how they will take it they enjoy nothing better than a good joke And with that he took e his leave It was a year later and the inspector was back again at the village school for his annual visit As the teacher was walking along the aisle with c him to the door he stopped and said By the way Mr Inspector how did your colleagues like the story of the horse and the number of his hairs The inspector slapped the teacher on the back Oh yes he said you know I was really very anxious to tell that story and a fine story it was but you see I wasn t able for the life of me to remember the number of hairs Warren McArthur graduated from Cornell in with a degree in mechanical engineering He began working in the budding field of industrial design patenting ten lamps between and He moved to Arizona in where he and his brother opened car dealerships Warren originally ventured into furniture design and construction as a hobby but at age he moved to Los Angeles to design and manufacture metal furniture He was among the pioneers in the use of aluminum for furniture and his contribution included improvements and patents to facilitate mass production He relocated his factory back East to New York in where he designed and manufactured unique aluminum furniture Imagine the Titanic floating overhead That s what it would have been like to see the USS Macon fly by Nearly feet long the airship was completed in as part of an effort to equip the U S Navy with airborne military bases With an onboard hangar Macon was capable of launching five small fixed wing planes in midair But it never saw action and went down off California s Big Sur coast during a storm in Rediscovered in when a fisherman caught a piece of the airship s debris in his net the wreck was recently surveyed and mapped using sonar and remotely operated robots Government archaeologists continue to explore the unique site which lies in feet of water The graph above shows the trends of snow sports participation in the four winter seasons from to in the U S Alpine skiing had the most participants and snowboarding had the second most across all four winter seasons Freestyle skiing however had the least participants in each of the four seasons Over the four winter seasons a steady increase was seen in the number of participants in both snowboarding and cross country skiing Compared to the previous season the number of participants in both alpine skiing and freestyle skiing decreased in the season The combined number of participants in snowboarding and cross country skiing in the season was smaller than the number of participants in alpine skiing in the same season The above graph shows the number of professionals per high school participants and the median lifetime earnings for the given six sports in the United States in Basketball had the highest median lifetime earnings and hockey had the highest number of professionals per high school participants Soccer had the lowest median lifetime earnings and the lowest number of professionals per high school participants Golf and baseball ranked second and third in median lifetime earnings respectively both had median lifetime earnings above million dollars The only two sports that had median lifetime earnings less than million dollars were football and soccer Except for hockey which had more than professionals per high school participants the remaining five sports all had less than professionals per high school participants The church Sveta Bogoroditsa Holy Virgin in Karlovo has a handsome profile with its blue and white bell tower The bell tower is relatively new from but the church building as the inscription above the western entrance tells us dates from Before they began constructing this new building in the older church of the Holy Virgin had burned down in This latter church about which little is known is believed by some to have been built already at the end of the fifteenth century at the time of the founding of the little town of Karli ova later Karlovo In any case the names of priests serving in the church have been preserved from the eighteenth century on Although the construction was completed in the events of the Crimean War and lack of funds delayed the furnishing of the church and its consecration did not take place until May Edwin Armstrong who first discovered and developed FM radio in the s and early s is often considered the most prolific and influential inventor in radio history He alone understood the impact of De Forest s vacuum tube and he used it to invent an amplifying system that enabled radio receivers to pick up distant signals Armstrong s innovations rendered useless the enormous alternators used for generating power in early radio transmitters In he sold a super version of his circuit to Radio Corporation of America RCA for and sixty thousand shares of RCA stock making him a millionaire as well as RCA s largest private stockholder Armstrong also worked on the major problem of radio reception electrical interference Between and the inventor filed five patents on FM The bar graph above shows the familiarity of the respondents with five prominent social media in and According to the graph the social media that was the most familiar in was blogging In the following year social networking became the most familiar social media Video blogging which was the least familiar social media in showed the biggest increase in familiarity among the three media that showed an increase from to Wikis showed a bigger decrease in familiarity than podcasting from to In podcasting and wikis were the least familiar social media During the early s a team of Italian scientists carried out a series of studies under a variety of circumstances on the ticklishness of people The researchers found that people seem to have one foot that is more ticklish than the other and for most people it is the right The experiment was repeated in using a special way that a pointed nylon rod was stroked across the bottom of the foot three times at intervals of a second After applying it to thirty four people the researchers confirmed the original finding and pushed back the frontiers of knowledge still further by showing that males were more ticklish than females One suggested explanation is that the left side of the brain which detects stimuli applied to the right foot is associated with positive emotions such as laughter Buffon was a famous zoologist and botanist during the reign of the French monarch Louis Buffon stocked the park at Versailles with wild animals He also expanded the botanical garden on the Left Bank in Paris And with the confidence that goes with being a great collector he began writing a comprehensive natural history of the world In that work Buffon expressed the biased opinion that native animals of the New World are smaller than those of Europe that there are fewer species of animals in America and that even domesticated species of European animals diminished in size and vigor upon crossing the Atlantic Obviously his opinions were not well received and were severely criticized in America The above diagram shows the average retention rate of

Netherlands is the world s largest tidal surge barrier It protects Zeeland from the constant threat of flooding Completed in it forms part of the Delta Project a line of massive sea defenses which was constructed after disastrous floods in As originally planned the barrier was to be a solid dam that by drastically restricting tidal flows would have destroyed much of the marine environment on the Eastern Scheldt In however a campaign forced the project to be suspended The project was revived four years later in a new and greatly modified form Instead of being permanently sealed the redesigned barrier is now normally open to the tides restricting their flow by only percent It is only when water levels reach meters above normal that steel gates close shut holding back even the most extreme waters The young of precocial birds belonging to the same clutch have a strong incentive to hatch as close together in time as possible The mother and the first hatched young will be on the move within hours chicks left behind in the eggs will die When the eggs of these species are incubated separately the hatching times are spread over a period of days but when they are kept together hatching times are close by within one or two hours This coordinated hatching is achieved by sound signals exchanged by the chicks while they are still in the eggs The most characteristic sound is a regular loud click which is most persistent just prior to hatching It is not caused by a tapping against the shell but is a vocalization associated with breathing movements The above graph shows the operating margin represented by the line and the net profit by the bars in the international airline industry from to In the operating margin reached its highest point Since the operating margin

endangered fly the Delhi Sands Flower loving Fly a rather pretty insect that takes nectar from local flowers This tiny creature has the distinction of being the first fly to be declared an endangered species in the U S Shortly after this fly was listed as an endangered species construction of a hospital parking lot was stopped The hospital had planned to construct its parking lot over seven acres of occupied fly habitat but that suddenly became illegal The hospital then had to spend million redrawing its plans and moving its parking lot feet Once a famous merchant port of the Portuguese empire Porto today gives the impression of a forgotten city It was built where the slow moving Duoro River flows to the Atlantic through the steep hills guarding the seashore It still carries the features of a busy medieval town in a strategically important location for defense With its magnificent castles overlooking the river and a rich history of wine making one might expect it to be one of the most visited cities in the world But hidden as it is in the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula few tourists make the trip The graph above shows the results of a survey conducted in regarding young Australians sources of advice by age group Friends parents and relatives were the three most common sources of advice for all age groups although their relative importance varied with age As age increased friends progressively became a more important source of advice while parents and relatives became less important Those aged from to turned more often to parents than friends for advice For young Australians aged from to friends was the biggest source of advice followed by parents For those aged from to their dependence upon mass media was the lowest among the three age groups while their dependence upon teachers was the highest A group of researchers have recently developed an artificial skin that can detect both pressure and temperature at the same time They inserted pressure sensors and temperature sensors in a thin plastic film to create a net like structure The new artificial skin is flexible enough to wrap around robot fingers and relatively inexpensive to make This breakthrough has the potential to improve how robots will function in the real world Future artificial skins could incorporate sensors not only for pressure and temperature but also for light humidity strain or sound The red fox often acts in ways that seem extremely crafty Trappers seeking red foxes must clean their equipment well to rid it of human smells or the foxes will not come near The foxes also manage to dig up hidden traps and set them off without being caught Red foxes have even been known to use a pedestrian underpass rather than cross a highway On the other hand red foxes are sometimes extremely careless They often come running in response to an imitation of their bark regardless of danger They readily return to areas where they have been heavily hunted in the past So whether or not the red fox is especially intelligent is an open question This chart shows the changes in the total value of electronic merchandise produced by the top five countries between and in

Notably among the top five countries China achieved the largest increase in amount in this period Japan also made an increase in electronic products but the Japanese increase was smaller than that of Germany Each of the five countries produced more electronic merchandise in than in The Mongol Empire was not a unified state but a vast collection of territories held together by military force Because it was controlled by military leaders the empire carried within it the seeds of its own breakdown Central power rested with the khan and his councilors Although they were well organized militarily the Mongols had no developed concept for ruling conquered populations New conquests were not administered just economically exploited In areas that were under control longer however there was some growth of administration Local bureaucracies usually followed administrative patterns that had been locally developed A device that enables the totally deaf to communicate with each other by

by chickens rabbits squirrels and birds Mason recalls that she didn t care much for dolls as a little girl but that she was fond of dressing up her favorite chickens in miniature clothes We had some very patient chickens she laughs In college Mason majored in ethology the study of animal behavior Today her fascination with animals plays a major role in her artistic life She combines her knowledge about animals with humor in her bronze sculptures Some people think art has to be about anxiety but I m trying to give the viewer a little something to smile about In ancient China people when presenting themselves before a superior knelt down and bumped their heads on the floor The kowtow ceremony was most commonly used in religious ceremonies when people came to make a request of the priest or when foreign government officials appeared before the Chinese emperor The word kowtow developed from a combination of two Chinese words a verb meaning to knock and a noun meaning head Although British officials were resistant to kowtowing to the Chinese emperor they did not object to the word and by the early s kowtow had become an English word for showing respect to another person From the th to the th centuries Europeans with tooth problems went to people called barber surgeons These people performed many services including cutting hair pulling teeth and treating medical conditions Dental treatment improved during the th and th centuries as they increased their knowledge about teeth Modern dentistry began in the s in France That was when Pierre Fauchard published his book called The Surgeon Dentist It was the first book about dental science The book provided information about dental problems for other dentists to use And it described ways to keep teeth healthy Pierre Fauchard is considered the father of modern dentistry On the first day I and a co worker went into the store after work Needless to say everything looked good The store was pretty well stocked We both took mental notes of things we d eventually get We wisely decided not to buy anything on that day We had plenty of time We walked around leisurely eyeing different items I said to myself Here are some cheap computer games That pair of roller blades for looks good too That battery powered electric shaver could sure come in handy Yes we were there to see the goods and to plan our purchases for the last day of the sale when the prices would be really low The arctic tern is an extraordinary bird that makes difficult journeys It flies up to kilometers every year all around the world from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again That s more than any other animal Arctic terns fly through all types of weather using the sun and stars to help them They spend almost all of their life in the air When they need food they catch fish from the sea Some arctic terns live thirty years or more so they travel over one million kilometers in their lifetime The bird is only thirty eight centimeters long and weighs around grams School education should include the skills needed in adult life as well as the study of knowledge and information Sports develop such skills by showing students how to keep fit how to work in a team and how to practice self discipline Children who haven t been given the chance to take part in physical activities can lose out on social skills when they get older On the other hand if forced to take part in sports in school they may well discover hidden talents Many famous sports people started their careers in this way Given this fact everybody should take a sports class in school Important social skills can be achieved through other activities such as charity work for old people instead of sports classes When something is forced the benefits it may bring are destroyed After all you can take a horse to water but you can t make it drink Taking part in a sports class should therefore be a matter of free choice for the students although encouraged by the school  The waves were perfect for surfing Dave however just could not stay on his board He had tried more than ten times to stand up but never managed it He felt that he would never succeed He was about to give up when he looked at the sea one last time The swelling waves seemed to say Come on Dave One more try Taking a deep breath he picked up his board and ran into the water He waited for the right wave Finally it came He jumped up onto the board just like he had practiced And this time standing upright he battled the wave all the way back to shore Walking out of the water joyfully he cheered Wow I did it The start of the boat tour was far from what I had expected None of the wildlife I saw was exotic I could only see dull gray rocks It was also so hot and humid that I could not enjoy the tour fully However as the boat slid into the Bay Park Canal all of a sudden my mother shouted Look at the mangroves A whole new world came into sight The mangrove forest alongside the canal thrilled me as we entered its cool shade I was fascinated by the beautiful leaves and flowers of the mangroves But best of all I was charmed by the native birds monkeys and lizards moving among the branches What a wonderful adventure I exclaimed All smiling Breaden a cute three year old boy was walking along the aisle of snacks bars and sweets It was the aisle of all kinds of temptation for him Wow he exclaimed Right in front of his eyes were rows of delicious looking chocolate bars waiting to be touched His mom was holding his hand Breaden her only child had always been the focus of her attention and she was cautious not to lose him in the market Suddenly she stopped to say hello to her friends Breaden stopped too With his eyes wide open and his mouth watering Breaden stretched out his arm and was about to grab a bar when he felt a tight grip on his hand He looked up Breaden not today He knew what that meant Okay Mommy he sighed His shoulders fell I m leaving early tomorrow morning finally I ve always wanted to explore the Amazon the unknown and mysterious world At this hour the great Emerald Amazon Explorer should be at the port waiting for me to get on board Freshwater dolphins will escort me on the playful river and species of birds half a dozen species of monkeys and numerous colorful butterflies will welcome me into their kingdom I wish I could camp in the wild and enjoy the company of mosquitos snakes and spiders I d love to make the world s largest rainforest home My heart swells as much as my chubby bags yet I d better get some sleep since a long tough journey is ahead of me As I walked to the train station I felt the warm sun on my back I caught my train on time It arrived at my destination ten minutes early which was perfect as I was due to present my new idea to the company at a m The presentation went better than expected and my manager seemed particularly pleased Later that day my manager called me into her office She smiled at me and said James you ve been with us for six years now How would you feel if I were to offer you the Sales Director position in London Sales Director in London Wow This was a dream come true for me I couldn t believe what I had just heard A I had volunteered for the charity picnic and I needed to be there on time Ms Green the charity president was preparing this monthly event by herself Lily complained Mom I don t feel like going today We ve volunteered more than five times this year She was eating slower than usual I urged her Lily don t you remember we promised to help Ms Green last month Go and get dressed I stood by the door and pointed at my watch She slowly pulled on her sweater and said I still don t feel like going I started losing my patience I responded Don t you know Ms Green has a lot of work to do for the picnic today It s time you started thinking about other people My voice was growing louder with each sentence I watched the beautiful stretch of the shoreline as it floated into view How wonderful it was After two days at sea I finally saw the land of infinite opportunities There it was before me smiling and inviting it was difficult for anyone to decline that invitation I was full of great plans to find success in this unknown land I had accepted a job offer from Dr Gilbert who had opened a medical clinic at an inland village last year It gave me great pleasure to think about how my dream would become a reality I looked again at the coast The line of distant mountains and shapes of houses were gradually emerging through the mist They welcomed me with endless promises It started out like any other day I had no idea that I was in for one of the most terrifying experiences of my life I headed to the beach and jumped on my surfboard and paddled out I was about yards off the beach when I felt a sudden chill in the air followed by an uncomfortable stillness Suddenly I heard the lifeguard scream Get out of the water There was a certain panic in his voice that demanded attention Then I saw something approaching me in the water It was big and gray and closing in on me fast I tried to paddle back to shore but my arms and legs were paralyzed Jess took another step forward The ground fell with unexpected sharpness and the water level seemed to jump from her knees to her waist She stopped for a moment and anxiously scanned the river before her Her legs started to shake and she felt her body stiffen And this was an unknown river There could be reeds or other dangers she didn t know about She was concerned that as a townie she d had little experience of the countryside and none at all of swimming in rivers It didn t look safe enough but she didn t want to turn back She took a deep breath and pushed herself into the water It felt nice and cool not as freezing as when she had first stepped into it The water seemed to welcome and embrace her She liked the clean luxuriant feeling as she swept down with the current After dinner he built a fire going out into the weather for wood he had piled against the garage The air was bright and cold against his face and the snow in the driveway was already halfway to his knees He gathered logs shaking off their soft white caps and carrying them inside He sat for a time in front of the fireplace cross legged adding logs and gazing at the warm fire Outside snow continued to fall quietly in the cones of light cast by the streetlights By the time he rose and looked out the window his car had become a soft white hill on the edge of the street Her nerves were hurting her She looked automatically again at the high uncurtained windows As night fell she could just perceive outside a huge tree swinging its branches The rain came flying on the window Ah why didn t she have peace These two men her husband and her son why did they not come She wrapped a large scarf around her and hesitated for a moment She opened the door and stepped out into the backyard There was no sign of a light anywhere She listened with all her ears but could hear nothing but the night James Shawn she called but nothing came from the darkness In Pamplona a white walled sun baked town high up in the hills of Navarre is held in the first two weeks of July each year the World s Series of bull fighting The cafes under the wide arcades that run around the Plaza de la Constitucion have every table crowded All day and all night there is dancing in the street Bands of blue shirted farmers circle and lift and swing behind a drum and various wind instruments in the ancient Basque Riau Riau dances And at night there is the beat of the big drums and the military band as the whole town dances in the great open square of the Plaza A boy entered a coffee shop where I worked as a waitress He sat at a table and asked me how much an ice cream sundae was Fifty cents I replied The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it How much is a dish of plain ice cream he inquired Some people were now waiting for a table and I was impatient Thirty five cents I said angrily The little boy again counted the coins and he ordered the plain ice cream I brought the ice cream and walked away The boy finished paid the cashier and departed When I came back I swallowed hard at what I saw There placed neatly beside the empty dish were fifteen pennies my tip I knocked at the door and was told to enter I found myself in a large room where the curtains were closed to allow no daylight in and the candles were lit In the center of the room sitting at a table was the strangest lady I had ever seen She was wearing a wedding dress made of rich material She had a bride s flowers in her hair but her hair was white She only had one white shoe on Then I realized that over the years the flowers in her hair had died and the bride inside the dress had grown old Everything in the room was ancient The only brightness in the room was in her dark old eyes that stared at me Our guest arrived in the broadcasting studio and I opened my show at with a brief introduction about his background Then I asked my first question and he just said I don t know A few more questions followed but all were answered in one of three ways Yes No or I don t know I looked up at the clock in the studio It was and I was out of material I had nothing left to ask this guy Everyone in the studio was standing around with the same thought What are we going to do We have fifty minutes left Listeners all over the country are going to reach for the tuning dials on their radios any second now After the snowstorm came thick fog and in that fog Fredrick s men soon lost their way on an ice river with hundreds of big holes in it Not only could they see nothing in front of them but they were tired and ill and could not walk any more So they had to stay in their tents near the mountains for four days After that time Fredrick went to Albert Marshall s tent You are ill Albert he said You can t come to the Pole Take two men and go back tomorrow Next day Fredrick watched regretfully as Marshall s sled disappeared slowly in the distance Shadows crept across the room cast from old furniture as the bright fire made them jump from side to side The winter storm blew against the windows throwing snow high against the sides of the small log cabin In the center of the room was a table with two old silver candlesticks and two glasses of red wine Soft music played in the background Between the two wine glasses was a small empty box It had contained a gold ring with a small diamond that his grandmother had given to him Tonight the girl across from him was wearing it beaming Before he closed his tired eyes he let them wander around his old small room It was made calm by the glow of the firelight that played on familiar things that had long been unconsciously a part of him Now with open arms they received him back He saw clearly how much it all meant to him and the special value of a place like this in one s life It was good to think he had this place to come back to and these things which could always be counted upon for the same simple welcome I took a riverboat from my hometown after years absence I like boat trips Looking into the water always leads me to some delightful thought Expecting the graceful curves woody heights and reflected images along the river that I remembered from my childhood I was thrilled as I boarded the boat I was looking forward to a wonderful day Yet this time as the boat was going up the river I felt something was lost No longer were the shores densely wooded nor could I see any wildlife anywhere It gave me a sick feeling All the grace and beauty had gone out of the majestic river During the whole of a day in the winter the clouds hung low in the sky I had been passing alone on horseback through an especially depressing area of the country At length I found myself as the evening shadows drew long within view of the cheerless house I looked upon the dark gray walls and upon a few white trunks of some dead trees I brought my horse to a stop at the edge of a black motionless mountain lake beside the old house and looked down upon the rotting dead tree stems and the empty eye like windows Vicky who is wearing a heavy winter coat is practicing on her high school stage for tomorrow s presentation of a play The event is presented as part of a school program that celebrates the end of the school year and shows what the students have learned Sumi one of Vicky s close friends has dropped by to say hello Hi Vicky It s really cold in here How s it going with your play So far so good Vicky replies but I may be getting cold feet I m really nervous about tomorrow Sumi adds with a worried look Tomorrow will be much colder so be sure to wear heavy socks Through the train window I could see crops ripening in the fields and trees turning red and yellow If this journey had taken place a week earlier all this would have pleased my eyes But now I could not enjoy it Too many thoughts were running through my head What had I done to Uncle Joe the man who had raised me for twenty years I felt ashamed for not having visited him for the last five years I disappointed him the man who loved me like a father I wasn t happy with myself knowing that last week he spent his sixtieth birthday alone Approaching Mr Howard s I at first thought that the house was on fire But as I turned the corner off the tree lined street I realized the whole house was shining with light The people in dresses and suits blocked my view of the garden Suddenly I heard the sound of a drum and the orchestra started to play People brought drinks from the bar and gathered in groups Some wanderers went from group to group floating in and out as if dancing to the music The air was alive with chatter and laughter which became easier minute by minute It was two hours before the paper submission With the deadline close at hand Claire was still struggling with her writing Pressed for time and stuck in a deadlock she had no idea how to finish the paper She wasn t even sure whether she could submit it on time What she found in her paper was scribbled words half sentences and a pile of seemingly strange and disjointed ideas Nothing makes sense she said to herself She looked at her writing and began reading it over and over All of a sudden and unexpectedly something was found in that pile of thoughts the flow and connection of ideas she had not considered while she was writing From this moment the ticking of the clock sounded encouraging to her Yes I can do it Claire said as she grabbed her pencil again Regularity is the key to mastery Jean Everything other than that is a waste of time stressed Ms Baker Jean s piano teacher with a troubled look However Jean complained quite often about practicing and slipped out of her sessions occasionally Concerned about Jean idling around Ms Baker decided to change her teaching method You can make your own schedule Jean However I want you to help me as an assistant said Ms Baker After that Jean practiced hard to be a good example to the beginners and her skills improved incredibly day after day The change in Jean was miraculous A smile came over Ms Baker s face as she listened to Jean play Ms Baker was convinced by Jean s improvement that her new teaching method was a success Sipping coffee leisurely at a caf Kate was enjoying the view of the Ponte Vecchio across the Arno As an architect and professor she had taught about the historical significance of the bridge to her students for years A smile crept across her face It was her first time to actually see it in person Though not as old as the bridges of Rome it was absolutely a work of art If the fleeing Nazis had destroyed it during World War II she would have never seen it She was happy that she could view the bridge in the twilight Free from her daily concerns her mind began to wander from the unforgettable views of the still Arno to all the unexpected but pleasant encounters with other tourists The trip was a rare liberating experience Kate felt that all her concerns had melted away When she heard the dogs barking fiercely on the floor just above her she trembled uncontrollably for fear of being caught Drops of cold sweat rolled down her back Before slipping into the hold of the boat she had scattered powder which Swedish scientists had developed unnoticeably on the floor above in order to distract the dogs But she knew that these dogs were so well trained that they could smell her even though a load of fish had been dumped over her hiding place She held her hands together tightly and tried not to make any noise She was not sure how long she could stay like that To her relief it wasn t long before a whistle called the dogs out leaving her unfound She relaxed her hands and exhaled a deep breath She felt safe now Stepping up to the microphone Gabby could feel the sweat starting to run down her face and neck She tried to take a deep breath but couldn t As her name was called Gabby became more afraid of speaking before a large audience Then she suddenly remembered the words of a woman who had gradually overcome the same fear Fear rapid heartbeat quick breathing and sweating are simply the body s declaration that we are ready to fight Recalling this Gabby calmed down and remembered clearly what she had to say Assured Gabby smiled and started to deliver her speech The words flowed out like water and her beating heart gave her more and more mental strength The performance was successful She had overcome her fear Early one night in in my old and cheap apartment in Bangor Maine I got a phone call from my agent Bill who was helping me publish my first novel Are you sitting down Bill asked No I said Do I need to You might he said The publication rights for your book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars I was completely speechless That amount of money was beyond my wildest expectations I was sure I hadn t heard him right I couldn t have I asked Did you say it went for forty thousand dollars Bill said it again as clearly as he could Four hundred thousand dollars Congratulations Steve Are you sure Bill I said in disbelief He said he was We talked for another half an hour but I don t remember a single word of what we said As Tom stood on stage at the school play he could feel the watchful eyes of the audience Being in the spotlight made him feel tense He tried to deliver his lines as best as he could but he could feel his voice shaking Suddenly he realized he had missed a sentence Without going back he went on as though nothing had happened But by the time he finished his hands felt sweaty and his heart was racing No one commented on his mistake apart from his drama teacher Well done the teacher said Acting is like learning to ride a bike You may not get it perfect the first time You may fall off a few times yet each time you get back on you do it better Your performance may not have been perfect but it was great His teacher s comforting words brought a smile to Tom s face I am a female dolphin who lives in an aquarium One day I got so badly injured that I couldn t swim and come up for air So my trainers attached bottles to me to act as floats I didn t want to live the rest of my life being supported by these bottles I was so aimless and dispirited I merely floated about and was sure I wasn t going to live for very long Seeing my depression my trainers brought in a male dolphin At first I ignored him but later began to show interest He tried to help me swim pushing me from under and bringing me to the surface Despite my injury I began making an effort to swim Soon the bottles were removed and I recovered completely It felt great to swim on my own again We became inseparable swimming joyfully around together and showing signs of affection It is the end of a long tiring day at Walt Disney World and a busload of parents and children are starting the twenty minute ride back to their hotel The children are overstimulated and annoyed and so are the parents Everyone is whiny It is a bus ride from hell Then rising above the unpleasant buzz of complaining children and parents comes a thin persistent melody The bus driver has started to sing the song Under the Sea from the movie The Little Mermaid Everyone begins to quiet down and listen Eventually a little girl joins in then several more children By the end of the ride everyone is singing The Circle of Life from the movie The Lion King The bus ride from hell has become the pleasurable song filled end to a full day And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate He would pull himself out of despair he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him There was time he was comparatively young yet he would revive his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him Tomorrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver He would find him tomorrow and ask for the position He would be somebody in the world I start my long journey with great enthusiasm The thought of conquering the mountain stirs me with anticipation Although the freezing wind pounds upon me I feel flushed with warmth Just after ten o clock in the morning I finally put my step on the ice covered peak of the mountain A childlike joy spreads through me I am the two hundred and ninth person to stand on the summit of Mount Everest My heart races as I take in this glorious moment The sky is deep blue and cloudless For fifteen minutes I cherish the view as the highest person on earth I do not feel the tiredness in my legs for the journey has been truly worthwhile Hey Jonathan said his voice causing two small birds to take flight The woman did not acknowledge him at all but continued to sketch Frowning he said a little louder Hey lady Again she did not acknowledge him and Jonathan began to wonder if she might be deaf Purposefully he walked up to the woman with every intention of telling her to leave from his backyard She did not even look up at him until he was standing within a couple of feet of her Only then did she look up For a moment Jonathan was struck by the most amazing green eyes he had ever seen He opened his mouth but instead of the sharp order he had intended to bark he asked quietly Who are you The woman smiled and he felt as if she lit up the world around her The wail of farm machinery had fallen silent and in the space it left I could hear the low gossip of hens the lower throat singing of turkeys and the varied sounds of birds in the trees Up on the green green shoulder of hill rising to the west I could see a small group of cattle grazing and below them on a gentler slope several dozen chickens wandering down to the meadow Laid before me was I realized a scene of almost classical rural beauty the meadows dotted with contented animals the woods in the background a twisting stream threading through it all spoiled only by the fact that I couldn t just lie here on this springy meadow admiring it for the rest of the afternoon I heard a sound and my heart beat quickly I was excited and when at last I saw him coming slowly down the stairs I caught my breath He was a tall old man with abundant white hair but his bushy eyebrows were dark still they made his great eyes flash with a more grave fire It was wonderful that at his age those black eyes should still preserve their brilliance There were in his air assurance and gentleness He was as I should have wished him to be and as I watched him I understood how he had moved men s minds and touched their hearts He was every inch a poet There were some places of worship in the city and the deep notes of their bells echoed over the town from morning until night The sun was shining brightly and cheerily and the air was warm The streams were flowing with bubbling water and the tender songs of birds came floating in from the fields beyond the city The trees were already awake and embraced by the blue sky Everything around the neighborhood the trees the sky and the sun looked so young and intimate that they were reluctant to break the spell which might last forever Solitude revealed to him all of nature s secrets and enveloped him in its delights He lived a peaceful life marveling at the wonders of nature and discovered sights unknown to the world in the rising and setting of the sun He knew what it was to tremble when he heard the hiss of a bird s wings over his head He spent the time enjoying himself looking around the vast open plain where red dry mists and dark clouds were rising At the end of the day he would welcome the night with joy listening to imaginary music in the skies It was very disturbing reading your article about how the farmers plan to handle the wild pig overpopulation on the Channel Islands Humans always seem to think that the best way to deal with any type of animal problem is to just kill them Isn t there another alternative than shooting these pigs Humans brought pigs over to these islands many years ago Now that they have overpopulated people want to murder them Where were all of the humans when the pigs started to multiply out of control On Saturday evenings my friends and I would go to the market We walked through the busy streets packed with drunken men and bargaining women amid the dancing and chanting of street singers We would laugh and cheer as magicians performed their tricks Even at these moments my love s name sprang to my lips in strange prayers which I myself did not understand My eyes were often full of tears I could not tell why and I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not If I spoke to her how could I tell her about my feelings of admiration As night fell my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires Watching Uncle Fred rowing the boat so strongly and so easily along Mike began to feel more and more jealous of him His pride began to whisper that he could do it The little boy asked again Please I want to row now With a smile Fred said It s not as easy as it looks But he handed him the oars knowing the water was shallow The boy pulled the oars back made a great dig at the water and missed the surface altogether He fell back and grabbed at the side of boat Instantly it turned over The struggling boy was gripped by Fred who was already standing in the water Carried to the shore in his uncle s arms the boy could not even look at him A fine powder filled the air and touched their cheeks The snow made everything look so different The brother and sister would not have known that it was the same forest However they set out bravely and took the path that seemed most promising holding on to each other and pretending cheerfulness Night fell and they soon lost all sense of time The snow was getting so deep that they could hardly drag their little legs through it and the trees were thicker and more like each other than ever There seemed to be no end to this forest no difference in it and worst of all no way out My job requires me to bring work home I need a work area where I can concentrate When I try to work my wife is always there with a steady stream of questions or small talk When I sit down to read I read only for a few minutes because she interrupts me Even when she isn t in the room I can hear her talking yelling or complaining in a tone that can t be ignored I suppose I should feel grateful that she wants to talk to me But the truth is I need my peace and quiet I have tried to discuss this with her but it only upsets her As we drove home Dad did not say a word With both hands on the wheel he stared at the dirt road My older brother Robert was also silent He leaned his head back and closed his eyes When I opened the front door to the hut I stopped Everything we owned was packed in cardboard boxes I sat down on a box The thought of having to move to an unfamiliar city brought tears to my eyes That night I could not sleep thinking about how much I hated this move How much farther to the finish line Can I make it Emma felt pain in her legs and was breathing heavily She couldn t remember ever being so exhausted Feeling frustrated she began to think about giving up on the race She knew she would regret it later but it seemed like there was nothing she could do Then she remembered a strategy she had learned By having strong imagery control she could help herself achieve her goal Over and over Emma imagined herself running smoothly and breathing easily It was working She started to feel better About thirty minutes later she found herself crossing the finish line with a big smile on her face Surrounded by cheering friends she enjoyed her victory full of joy A tear rolled down Lindsay s cheek She thought she had put her favorite toy Blue Bunny in her bag before school this morning She had show and tell in class today and she was anxious Her teacher Mrs Cline might be angry that she had forgotten to bring it She quickly searched the classroom and checked her bag one more time Her precious Blue Bunny was a gift from her father who worked overseas It was nowhere to be found Just then Mrs Cline appeared in the doorway Mrs Cline Lindsay cried I can t find my toy to show in class today I m sorry Mrs Cline smiled gently She was holding the toy Oh Mrs Cline Thank you I thought I had lost Blue Bunny Lindsay felt calm and comforted now that she had her toy again Amy was in the classroom staring out of the window beside her She thought how her gloomy face in the window reflected her mistake She tried not to think about her terrible performance in class Watching Amy look so discouraged Laurie her best friend decided she needed some cheering up So Laurie crossed her eyes and made a stupid face Amy tried not to look but Laurie was making another funny face This time she couldn t help turning back to see what her friend was doing It was her famous fish face she was pushing her ears out crossing her eyes and opening her mouth wide Amy laughed hard She felt that she was lucky to have a friend that could always cheer her up when she was feeling down On my first day in the Emergency Center I was about to drink my coffee when the first call came I quickly picked up the line My voice was trembling and my heart was racing A woman cried My husband s not breathing I instructed her to begin CPR I was trying to be as steady as I could but I was shaking The situation was absolutely critical While she was performing CPR I immediately notified the nearby hospital After a few tense moments she came back on the line and shouted Where s the ambulance I replied It s getting there as quickly as it can Delia stepped out of the front door of her house and the day welcomed her with a warm and sunny smile With each step she thought I can t wait for today s class Her family had recently moved into the neighborhood and the new school year had just begun at Elanova High School Her new school offered ballet lessons and Delia eagerly signed up She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a ballerina Delia sat at the bench waiting for the school bus As the bus rolled down Madison Avenue she slipped her hand into her ballet bag to touch her new shoes She thought about working hard on her leaps and jumps I want to soar to the moon Delia thought Kate ran to the mailbox as soon as the mail truck drove away She opened the mailbox and reached into the dark space Her hope quickly disappeared however There was nothing addressed to her It was her sixteenth birthday today but there wasn t even a birthday card from her father I didn t get anything from Dad said Kate to her mother I can t believe he forgot my birthday Kate s father was a doctor and every summer he went to Africa to treat people who were too poor to go to a hospital Well he didn t forget your birthday Kate I was going to give this to you at your birthday party this afternoon said her mother giving her a small pink box with a purple ribbon which arrived from Africa the day before Yeah I knew Dad wouldn t let me down shouted Kate smiling the sweetest smile Over the sky a plump black cloud moved erasing the stars At that moment Liz heard a stealthy step far to her left and immediately froze She slowly released her knees and straightened her head the better to hear The movement stopped and after a long moment began again Liz saw a dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the trees The figure stood so still and low to the ground that it might have been a stump She called softly Tim Hearing an answering whistle she went toward her son and with tears of delight hugged him tightly It was the day of the audition I hadn t slept a wink the previous night Strangely I wasn t tired It could have been the adrenaline pumping through my veins or maybe it was the five cups of coffee I drank that morning Either way I couldn t sit still I kept getting up and down from my chair pacing around the room A dozen thoughts went through my head Would I remember my lines Would I be able to display the right emotions I kept telling myself to relax but the butterflies in my stomach had an intention of their own When my name was called I slowly stepped in front of the judges Their gaze fell heavy upon me My mind drew a complete blank Michael dared to look inside the window but from the deep shadow of the trees and the gloom within he could not clearly make out the objects within Although every nerve in his body cautioned otherwise he slowly pushed open the door The door creaked as it swung back As he carefully took a step inside the door slammed shut Michael s futile attempts to open the door only increased his panic He tried to calm his thundering heart by repeating to himself I am not afraid I am not afraid but to no avail He suddenly felt an uneasy darkness consume him from within He opened his mouth to call for help but his words failed him My mother gave me some strawberry jam to take to Mrs Sampson It was winter and when she opened the door I was overcome by the smell of the stove and the damp dark atmosphere I was afraid of Mrs Sampson She was a big woman with gray skin like clay with a couple of gray hairs sticking out of her chin She always wore a dirty mud colored cardigan over shapeless dresses Worst of all she had bad breath Here you are dear she said in her scratchy voice and put a dollar bill in my hand but don t spend it all at once I fled back to the relative safety of my own home I took a room in the Draco Hotel a pleasant hotel and a pleasant room small but comfortable with a telephone a small color television and its own bathroom I was highly pleased and full of expectations about being in a new place I dumped my things and went out to look around the town I soon came to be grateful for not living there It was entirely the opposite of my expectations The hotel was in a dark neighborhood of shipping offices and warehouses There were also a couple of banks a very large police station with its paint peeling off and a weather beaten post office with a row of telephone booths in front I noticed that the telephone books in the booths had been torn or burned and hung from their chains Away across a hundred miles the mountain tops looked like islands in the fog that floated below us Grandpa pointed to the east and said Watch Above the rim of the farthest mountain on the end of the world a pink stripe swept across and a paint brush swept a million miles across the sky The morning birth came alive and morning wind picked up The mountain rim looked like it had caught fire then the sun cleared the trees It turned the fog into a pink ocean with its waves gently rolling up and down Grandpa said the world had got born all over again and he took off his hat and we watched the sunrise for a long time Henry was moving the soccer ball down the field thrilled with the prospect of scoring a goal the first in his entire life In his haste he didn t realize that his teammates weren t anywhere near him Concentrating filled with expectation he sped eagerly toward the goal It wasn t until the last second that he noticed who the goalkeeper was his teammate It was too late however as Henry s foot had already begun moving to kick the ball into the net A perfect kick Then total silence Henry realized that he had made a terrible mistake He had scored for the opposing team Henry glanced at his coach who looked furious as he screamed at him He wanted the earth to swallow him up Twenty four year old Bob was swimming along the beach about one hundred yards offshore When he was forty feet away from a group of bathers who were swimming in about five feet of water he suddenly let out a scream All the bathers could hear was a lot of noise resulting from Bob s attempts to get out of the water One of the group Tim realizing that something was wrong rushed to Bob s aid Tim grabbed the struggling Bob and attempted to pull him toward shore but in vain Some lifeguards immediately launched their surf boat and set out toward the troubled swimmer I don t know politics but I know the names of those people in power and can repeat them like the days of the week or the names of the months beginning with Nehru I am Indian very brown born in Malabar I speak three languages write in two and dream in one Don t write in English they said English is not your mother tongue Why not leave me alone critics friends visiting cousins every one of you Why not let me speak in any language I like The language I speak becomes mine Though it seems funny as being half English and half Indian it voices my joys my longings and my hopes This would be a day both father and son could treasure all their lives the boy s first day at Fenway Park and the day they d both looked forward to for so long They took a chance at the reserved seat ticket window and were rewarded with a pair of lower box seats The boy sat in the second row just a few feet away from the field And the father watched him and felt his heart bursting with joy They did all the things they had planned hotdogs ice cream sandwiches reading the scoreboard watching the crowd chasing foul balls and cheering This is what life is all about the father thought A boy and his dad and baseball Nothing beats it It is truly an honor to have received the Fisher Scholarship for I am flattered to have been chosen to receive this scholarship I think chemistry is an interesting field full of opportunities I am proud of being a chemistry major here at Roanoke College I look forward to beginning a career in the chemical industry or perhaps in education Because of your financial support I have had the opportunity to receive a wonderful education I hope that you will continue to support academics at Roanoke College I lecture for about half an hour Then I notice that the students are beginning to look at the ceiling one is feeling for his handkerchief another shifts in his seat another smiles at his thoughts and so on This means they are distracted Something must be done Taking advantage of the first opportunity I make a joke A broad grin comes on to a hundred and fifty faces the eyes shine brightly and the thunder of laughter is audible for a brief moment I laugh too Their attention is refreshed and I can go on I had overslept at the hotel missing breakfast and had to leap into my clothes I couldn t find a cab and had to drag my overweight bag eight blocks to the Central Bus Station I had huge difficulty persuading the staff at the bank on Johansgate Street to cash sufficient traveler s checks to pay the krone bus fare They simply could not understand that the William McGuire Bryson on my passport and the Bill Bryson on my traveler s checks were both me Now here I was arriving at the station two minutes before departure breathless and steaming from the endless uphill struggle that is my life and the girl at the ticket counter was telling me that she had no record of my reservation The monster suddenly felt a strange need to get up and look at himself in the mirror He relit his candle When he saw his face reflected in the polished glass he scarcely recognized it it seemed to him as though he had never yet seen himself His eyes looked to him enormous and he was pale yes without doubt he was pale very pale He remained standing in front of the mirror He put out his tongue as though to check the state of his health and abruptly the thought struck him like a bullet The day after tomorrow at this very hour I may no longer be in this world His heart began its furious beating again Being the brightest member of my third grade class I was asked to recite a rather lengthy poem for a school event My initial response to the task was No big deal and I jumped at the opportunity to be in the spotlight yet again I casually practiced my presentation at home The day came I began to recite the poem but I suddenly lost my memory and could say only two lines before I dried up My face became red with embarrassment as the audience giggled quietly and my teacher secretly fed me my lines Volcanoes are very powerful in our minds because we are attracted by fire Volcanoes are making a show each time we go there It is a wonderful show of nature the best we can imagine When we are on volcanoes and they are erupting we are just nothing We have this big mountain exploding all these powerful things going on we are just small small creatures and this is fantastic Normal mountains are really dead compared to volcanoes We can t help falling in love with these living mountains My hometown is famous for its scenic beauty and its flowers The lilac fair is especially well known In the spring when the lilacs are at their most beautiful many people come from all over the country to visit the town and see the fair It is wonderful to see families walking together among the lilacs parents carrying small children on their shoulders while others run and play around them Meanwhile teenagers dance to the rhythm of the music on their cassette players and old people sit on park benches eating their packed meals They all feel lucky to be alive and healthy at this time It is difficult for them to imagine a better day out  Dear Mr Reese A few days ago I submitted my application and recipe for the nd Annual DC Metro Cooking Contest However I would like to change my recipe if it is possible I have checked the website again but I could only find information about the contest date time and prizes I couldn t see any information about changing recipes I have just created a great new recipe and I believe people will love this more than the one I have already submitted Please let me know if I can change my submitted recipe I look forward to your response War is inconceivable without some image or concept of the enemy It is the presence of the enemy that gives meaning and justification to war War follows from feelings of hatred wrote Carl Schmitt War has its own strategic tactical and other rules and points of view but they all presuppose that the political decision has already been made as to who the enemy is The concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment of war The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the act of killing from the act of murder However we need to be cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy that informs it in an abstract and uniform way Rather both must be seen for the cultural and contingent phenomena that they are Although not the explicit goal the best science can really be seen as refining ignorance Scientists especially young ones can get too obsessed with results Society helps them along in this mad chase Big discoveries are covered in the press show up on the university s home page help get grants and make the case for promotions But it s wrong Great scientists the pioneers that we admire are not concerned with results but with the next questions The highly respected physicist Enrico Fermi told his students that an experiment that successfully proves a hypothesis is a measurement one that doesn t is a discovery A discovery an uncovering of new ignorance The Nobel Prize the pinnacle of scientific accomplishment is awarded not for a lifetime of scientific achievement but for a single discovery a result Even the Nobel committee realizes in some way that this is not really in the scientific spirit and their award citations commonly honor the discovery for having opened a field up transformed a field or taken a field in new and unexpected directions With the industrial society evolving into an information based society the concept of information as a product a commodity with its own value has emerged As a consequence those people organizations and countries that possess the highest quality information are likely to prosper economically socially and politically Investigations into the economics of information encompass a variety of categories including the costs of information and information services the effects of information on decision making the savings from effective information acquisition the effects of information on productivity and the effects of specific agencies such as corporate technical or medical libraries on the productivity of organizations Obviously many of these areas overlap but it is clear that information has taken on a life of its own outside the medium in which it is contained Information has become a recognized entity to be measured evaluated and priced We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries Increasing aid for the world s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation With percent of carbon emissions from mostly tropical deforestation carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost effective forms of abatement Perhaps the most cost effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences To help societies prevent or reduce damage from catastrophes a huge amount of effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately However recent behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption Many people do not understand large numbers Indeed large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect feeling This creates a paradox that rational models of decision making fail to represent On the one hand we respond strongly to aid a single individual in need On the other hand we often fail to prevent mass tragedies or take appropriate measures to reduce potential losses from natural disasters Biological organisms including human societies both with and without market systems discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives For example the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines where most investment happens before they begin producing may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner and a larger relative proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process and not upfront Thus fossil fuels particularly oil and natural gas in addition to having energy quality advantages cost storability transportability etc over many renewable technologies also have a temporal advantage after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumption return Industrial capitalism not only created work it also created leisure in the modern sense of the term This might seem surprising for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their machinery running as long as possible and forced their employees to work very long hours However by requiring continuous work during work hours and ruling out non work activity employers had separated out leisure from work Some did this quite explicitly by creating distinct holiday periods when factories were shut down because it was better to do this than have work promoted by the casual taking of days off Leisure as a distinct non work time whether in the form of the holiday weekend or evening was a result of the disciplined and bounded work time created by capitalist production Workers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was enlarged by union campaigns which first started in the cotton industry and eventually new laws were passed that limited the hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements Leisure was also the creation of capitalism in another sense through the commercialization of leisure This no longer meant participation in traditional sports and pastimes Workers began to pay for leisure activities organized by capitalist enterprises Mass travel to spectator sports especially football and horse racing where people could be charged for entry was now possible The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated for whole new industries were emerging to exploit and develop the leisure market which was to become a huge source of consumer demand employment and profit Dear Ms Diane Edwards I am a teacher working at East End High School I have read from your notice that the East End Seaport Museum is now offering a special program the Bug Lighthouse Experience The program would be a great opportunity for our students to have fun and experience something new I estimate that students and teachers from our school would like to participate in it Would you please let me know if it is possible to make a group reservation for the program for Saturday November We don t want to miss this great opportunity I look forward to hearing from you soon Best regards Joseph Loach At the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit Ginni Rometty offered this advice When did you ever learn the most in your life What experience I guarantee you ll tell me it was a time you felt at risk To become a better leader you have to step out of your comfort zone You have to challenge the conventional ways of doing things and search for opportunities to innovate Exercising leadership not only requires you to challenge the organizational status quo but also requires you to challenge your internal status quo You have to challenge yourself You have to venture beyond the boundaries of your current experience and explore new territory Those are the places where there are opportunities to improve innovate experiment and grow Growth is always at the edges just outside the boundaries of where you are right now One exercise in teamwork I do at a company retreat is to put the group in a circle At one particular retreat there were eight people in the circle and I slowly handed tennis balls to one person to start throwing around the circle If N equals the number of people in the circle then the maximum number of balls you can have in motion is N minus Why Because it s almost impossible to throw and catch at the same time The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the importance of an individual s action People are much more concerned about catching the ball than throwing it What this demonstrates is that it s equally important to the success of the exercise that the person you re throwing to catches the ball as that you are able to catch the ball If you re less concerned about how you deliver information than with how you receive it you ll ultimately fail at delegation You have to be equally skilled at both Sensory specific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed with little change in the hedonics of uneaten food As a result of sensory specific satiety when people consume a variety of foods they tend to overeat A greater variety of food leads people to eat more than they would otherwise So being full and feeling sated are separate matters The recovery of appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who has consumed a large meal and is quite full and does not require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily needs but decides to consume additional calories after seeing the dessert cart Small changes in the sensory properties of foods are sufficient to increase food intake For example subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of pasta Individual authors and photographers have rights to their intellectual property during their lifetimes and their heirs have rights for years after the creator s death so any publication less than years old has to be checked for its copyright status The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years the life plus years standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of which increased the year limit established by the Copyright Act Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts Therefore the extended copyright protection frustrates new creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics on Internet sites Time spent on on line interaction with members of one s own preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people If physicists for example were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area they would likely devote less time and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas In this regard even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today s distributed virtual archives because it seems difficult to use the available search engines to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelf search of an extensive library collection In one sense every character you create will be yourself You ve never murdered but your murderer s rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade even though the circumstances are totally different and you re not even consciously thinking about your middle school years Our characters emotions after all draw on our own emotions Sometimes however you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction dramatizing actual incidents Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself The problem with this and it is a very large problem is that almost no one can view himself on the page As the writer you re too close to your own complicated makeup It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you In fact that s what authors largely have done You can still of course incorporate aspects of yourself your love of Beethoven your quick temper your soccer injuries But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation by definition did not have Want to improve

human ambitions are simply unsustainable in both the rich and poor nations They draw too heavily too quickly on already overdrawn environmental resource accounts to be affordable far into the future without bankrupting those accounts They may show profit on the balance sheets of our generation but our children will inherit the losses We borrow environmental capital from future generations with no intention or prospect of repaying They may blame us for our wasteful ways but they can never collect on our debt to them We act as we do because we can get away with it future generations do not vote they have no political or financial power they cannot challenge our decisions The precision of the lines on the map the consistency with which symbols are used the grid and or projection system the apparent certainty with which place names are written and placed and the legend and scale information all give the map an aura of scientific accuracy and objectivity Although subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these cartographic elements the finished map appears to express an authoritative truth about the world separate from any interests and influences The very trust that this apparent objectivity inspires is what makes maps such powerful carriers of ideology However unnoticeably maps do indeed reflect the world views of either their makers or more probably the supporters of their makers in addition to the political and social conditions under which they were made Some of the simple ideological messages that maps can convey include This land is and has long been ours here is the center of the universe if we do not claim this land the enemies you most fear will As a system for transmitting specific factual information without any distortion or ambiguity the sign system of honey bees would probably win easily over human language every time However language offers something more valuable than mere information exchange Because the meanings of words are not invariable and because understanding always involves interpretation the act of communicating is always a joint creative effort Words can carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own perspectives to the language they encounter Ideas expressed imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for listeners or readers than simple facts The fact that language is not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated in someone else s mind is a reflection of its powerful strength as a medium for creating new understanding It is the inherent ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaning making system that makes the relationship between language and thinking so special The film director as compared to the theater director has as his material the finished recorded celluloid This material from which his final work is composed consists not of living men or real landscapes not of real actual stage sets but only of their images recorded on separate strips that can be shortened altered and assembled according to his will The elements of reality are fixed on these pieces by combining them in his selected sequence shortening and lengthening them according to his desire the director builds up his own filmic time and filmic space He does not adapt reality but uses it for the creation of a new reality and the most characteristic and important aspect of this process is that in it laws of space and time invariable and inescapable in work with actuality become obedient The film assembles from them a new reality proper only to itself The impacts of tourism on the environment are evident to scientists but not all residents attribute environmental damage to tourism Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas improves the quality of the roads and public facilities and does not contribute to ecological decline Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems overcrowded outdoor recreation or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks Alternatively some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing hunting and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion Some studies suggest that variations in residents feelings about tourism s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions Duration refers to the time that events last If we think of tempo as the speed of events then duration is the speed of the clock itself For the physicist the duration of a second is precise and unambiguous it is equal to cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium In the realm of psychological experience however quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation When people are removed from the cues of real time be it the sun bodily fatigue or timepieces themselves it doesn t take long before their time sense breaks down And it is this usually accurate psychological clock as opposed to the time on one s watch that creates the perception of duration that people experience Theoretically a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo Imagine for example that baseballs are pitched to two different batters The balls are thrown every seconds for seconds so a total of balls are thrown We now ask both batters how much time has passed Let s say that batter number one who loves hitting feels the duration to be seconds Batter number two bored by baseball believes it to be seconds Psychologically then the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds The perceived tempo in other words is slower for batter number one Dear Coach Johnson My name is Christina Markle Bradley Markle s mother Bradley and I were thrilled to learn that you re holding your Gymnastics Summer Camp again this year So I didn t hesitate to sign up and pay the non refundable deposit for the second week program which is from July to But today I remembered that our family is going to get back from a trip on July and I m afraid Bradley won t be able to make it on the very first day of the program Rather than make him skip the day I d like to check to see if he could switch to the third week program Please let us know if that s possible Thank you Sincerely Christina Markle Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic of counselors If your picture of a counselor is someone who never disagrees always goes along wants everything to be nice all the time and only does what other people want himor her to do this is not a picture of an assertive counselor Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke An assertive counselor would find a way to call that person s attention to the fact that the joke is racist explaining how it offended the hearer and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided Being assertive is a highly developed skill it should fit nicely in the counselor s repertoire of techniques The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students Twin sirens hide in the sea of history tempting those seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of misunderstanding and misinterpretation These twin dangers are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism Temporocentrism is the belief that your times are the best of all possible times All other times are thus inferior Ethnocentrism is the belief that your culture is the best of all possible cultures All other cultures are thus inferior Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other individuals and cultures by the superior standards of their current culture This leads to a total lack of perspective when dealing with past and or foreign cultures and a resultant misunderstanding and misappreciation of them Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism tempt moderns into unjustified criticisms of the peoples of the past When we remark with surprise that someone looks young for his or her chronological age we are observing that we all age biologically at different rates Scientists have good evidence that this apparent difference is real It is likely that age changes begin in different parts of the body at different times and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells tissues and organs as well as from person to person Unlike the passage of time biological aging resists easy measurement What we would like to have is one or a few measurable biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes without reference to the passage of time so that we could say for example that someone who is chronologically eighty years old is biologically sixty years old This kind of measurement would help explain why one eighty year old has so many more youthful qualities than does another eighty year old who may be biologically eighty or even ninety years old Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control There can be broad influential factors sometimes of an economic nature that hold down the performance of everyone being judged One example is in sales If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year sales could be down for example by an average of This actually figure would then represent average performance Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a drop in sales over the previous year Thus good performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use Of course the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge In the middle of the th century Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were He answered Madam what good is a baby Of course Faraday s experiments were the beginning of the electronic age Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world transistors vaccines plastics began as basic research Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional Science is the study of nature and as we learn more about how nature works we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us The seemingly resourceful knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature Science tells us where we are and what we are and that knowledge is beyond value One difference between winners and losers is how they handle losing Even for the best companies and most accomplished professionals long track records of success are punctuated by slips slides and mini turnarounds Even the team that wins the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it That s why the ability to recover quickly is so important Troubles are ubiquitous Surprises can fall from the sky like volcanic ash and appear to change everything That s why one prominent scholar said Anything can look like a failure in the middle Thus a key factor in high achievement is bouncing back from the low points Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the doing than by mere abstract study This is often the case with the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical disciplines For example within the philosophical disciplines logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual problem solving Only after some time and struggle does the student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of thinking This learning by doing is essential in many of the sciences For instance only after a good deal of observation do the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the specific movements of identifiable particles The most normal and competent child encounters what seem like insurmountable problems in living But by playing them out he may become able to cope with them in a step by step process He often does so in symbolic ways that are hard for even him to understand as he is reacting to inner processes whose origin may be buried deep in his unconscious This may result in play that makes little sense to us at the moment since we do not know the purposes it serves When there is no immediate danger it is usually best to approve of the child s play without interfering Efforts to assist him in his struggles while well intentioned may divert him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will serve him best At some time in their lives most people pause to reflect on their own moral principles and on the practical implications of those principles and they sometimes think about what principles people should have or which moral standards can be best justified When a person accepts a moral principle naturally the person believes the principle is important and well justified But there is more to moral principles than that When a principle is part of a person s moral code that person is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the principle and against behavior that conflicts with that principle The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of others whose behavior conflicts with it Likewise the person will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an abundance of the motivation required by the principle The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the actions you re taking should be the natural next step One of the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation is our tendency to focus on the end result Skiers who are unsure of themselves often do this They ll go to the edge of a difficult slope look all the way down to the bottom and determine that the slope is too steep for them to try The ones that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what they need to do to master the first step like getting through the first mogul on the hill Once they get there they concentrate on the next mogul and over the course of the run they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an impossible mountain Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly established that certain works have certain effects Plato is sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us cowardly the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress such representations Tolstoy is confident that the artist who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those feelings on to us we can no more escape than we could escape an infectious disease In fact however the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes Some people may indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of working out those fantasies in real life Others may be disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence Still others may be left unmoved neither attracted nor disgusted Increased size affects group life in a number of ways There is evidence that larger groups five or six members are more productive than smaller groups two or three members Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups and although they seem to reach less agreement they also show less tension These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal directed since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform In such groups it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result Groups with an even number of members may split into halves This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members one side always has a numerical advantage According to some researchers the number five has special significance Groups of this size usually escape the problems we have just outlined Moreover they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction because of the odd number of members deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur B In order to successfully release himself from the control of his parents a child must be secure in his parents power as represented by their loving authority The more effectively they communicate that authority the more secure the child feels and the better able he is to move away from them toward a life of his own During this lengthy process whenever he feels threatened he turns back toward the safety of his parents love and authority In other words it is impossible for a child to successfully release himself unless he knows exactly where his parents stand both literally and figuratively That requires of course that his parents know where they themselves stand If they don t know where they stand if in other words they are insecure in their authority they cannot communicate security to their child and he cannot move successfully away from them Under the circumstances he will become clingy or disobedient or both The names of pitches are associated with particular frequency values Our current system is called A because the note we call A that is in the middle of the piano keyboard has been fixed to have a frequency of Hz This is entirely arbitrary We could fix A at any frequency such as or different standards were used in the time of Mozart than today Some people claim that the precise frequencies affect the overall sound of a musical piece and the sound of instruments Led Zeppelin a band popular in the s often tuned their instruments away from the modern A standard to give their music an uncommon sound and perhaps to link it with the European children s folk songs that inspired many of their compositions Many purists insist on hearing baroque music on period instruments both because the instruments have a different sound and because they are designed to play the music in its original tuning standard something that purists deem important A Good news for pet shop owners We ABLE Shipping have developed the perfect system for shipping fish to your customers We can ship live fish across the nation and the fish will do just fine Are you wondering how we ensure each fish has a safe journey Here s the secret We pack each one

journey all the way to your customers front doors Call us at or e mail us at fishlove ableshipping com and you ll see how it works In our efforts to be the good child the uncomplaining employee or the cooperative patient many of us fall into the trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever they want us to do At times we lose track of our own boundaries and needs and the cost of this could be our life both symbolically and literally When we are unable to set healthy limits it causes distress in our relationships But when we learn to say no to what we don t feel like doing in order to say yes to our true self we feel empowered and our relationships with others improve So don t be afraid to say no Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true voice to say what you really want to say Some people punish themselves when they are under time pressure They delete all the games on their PC they stop going for walks and they don t spend time with their friends They then have less pleasure in life and less balance and their work performance actually declines Break out of this pattern by paying more attention to relaxation and getting more involved in living when you are under pressure Define clear time periods for this half an hour for a walk ten minutes to play a game on your PC and so on Your mind will become more creative during the break and you will become mentally fitter Free time without feelings of guilt will give you the strength to do high quality work in the remaining time Furthermore a certain amount of recreation reduces the chances of developing stress related disorders Large animals are actually less dangerous to hikers than smaller ones Common sense tells us that we should avoid tigers bears and other large threatening animals But smaller animals are actually more threatening than bigger animals To overcome disadvantages of their size small animals have developed useful weapons such as poison to protect themselves in the wild Each year only a few people are attacked by tigers or bears and most of these incidents are caused by the people themselves However more people are killed by bites from small poisonous snakes than by these large animals Even more people lose their lives from allergic reactions to common bee stings For these reasons hikers should be careful about small dangerous creatures It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others It is not just the size of the park that matters Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences and players know this So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one say percent better One analysis found that the player hit percent more home runs Why The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is If you think you are likely to hit more home runs you are more likely to swing for the fences But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base In business and life just as in baseball our perceptions can affect whether we swing for the fences or not The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be Consider your work and your current life Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier As you are well aware a great tragedy took place in our city last week Some faulty electrical wiring led to a fire breaking out and eventually destroying an entire block of homes in the suburbs From the very beginning it was fanned by strong winds but it would not have spread so far and so quickly if our firefighters had been able to arrive at the scene in time Our city has only one fire station located downtown Would you please establish a new fire station in our area since you are mayor of our city We are in urgent need of one I look forward to your response Although praise may encourage children to continue an activity while an adult is watching according to recent studies they are less likely to continue the activity when the adult leaves or to repeat the activity in the future Rather than increasing children s commitment to positive behavior praise encourages children to find ways to get future verbal goodies from important adults In other words praise is like the large pink icing rose in the center of a cake It is appealing and at first bite its sweetness tastes wonderful A couple more bites still might taste good but it quickly becomes overly sweet It has only one simple flavor we soon tire of it and if we eat very much at any one time we might even feel slightly ill It may provide some quick energy but it provides no nourishment and doesn t support growth or health What s dangerous about the Internet is because it has the aura of technology around it it has a totally undeserved instant credibility The fact that information is conveyed in this high tech manner somehow adds authority to what is conveyed when in fact the Internet is a global conveyer of unfiltered unedited untreated information It is the greatest tool we have not only for making people smarter quicker but also for making people dumber faster Rumors published on the Internet now have a way of immediately becoming facts This is particularly true among people who might not themselves have access to the Internet but hear a piece of news or gossip from the people around them who do have access Why is it difficult to find a runner who competes equally well in both m and m races The primary reason is that our muscles contain two main types of muscle fibers called slow and fast muscle fibers Slow muscle fibers are muscle cells that can sustain repeated contractions but don t generate a lot of quick power for the body They perform better in endurance exercises like long distance running which require slow steady muscle activity Fast muscle fibers are cells that can contract more quickly and powerfully than slow muscle fibers but fatigue much more easily they function best for short bursts of intense activity like weight lifting or sprinting Scientists should be careful to reduce bias in their experiments A bias occurs when what the scientist expects changes how the results are viewed This expectation might cause a scientist to select a result from one trial over those from other trials Scientists can lessen bias by running as many trials as possible and by keeping accurate notes of each observation made Valid experiments also must have data that are measurable This allows others to compare the results to data they obtain from a similar experiment Most importantly the experiment must be repeatable Findings are supportable when other scientists perform the same experiment and get the same results I once heard a woman say Of course he s successful It s in his genes I knew she wasn t talking about me because I was wearing shorts I also knew she was wrong Success is not in our genes Not all children of successful people become successful themselves Many kids have everything going for them and end up total disasters They do none of the things that helped their parents succeed The number of unsuccessful people who come from successful parents is proof that genes have nothing to do with success You can t change your genes but you can change the people you imitate The choice is up to you so why not imitate the best There are hundreds of great people to imitate and copy They have terrific advice about what helped them succeed Jot down notes and carry them around in your pants pocket Then success will be in your jeans even if it s not in your genes In the early s Norway introduced a carbon tax on emissions from energy and it did seem to encourage environmental innovation However unexpected circumstances came when they tried to apply this approach globally Agreeing on international taxes on emissions was notoriously hard as we already know that the European Union has experienced terrible difficulties in trying to regularize the complex and myriad differences in its members sales taxes Besides although Sweden Finland and Denmark barely decided to introduce carbon taxes during the s they have not harmonized their approaches with Norway or with each other If such similar countries can t come to an agreement there is little hope for doing so with the vastly more diverse countries in the rest of the world Why in country after country that mandated seat belts was it impossible to see the promised reduction in road accident fatalities John Adams professor of geography at University College London wrote in one of his many essays on risk It appears that measures that protect drivers from the consequences of bad driving encourage bad driving The principal effect of seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of risk from those already best protected in cars to the most vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists outside cars Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings under the concept of risk compensation the idea that humans have an inborn tolerance for risk As safety features are added to vehicles and roads drivers feel less vulnerable and tend to take more chances The phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily lives Children who wear protective gear during their games have a tendency to take more physical risks Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can access them easily What should writers do when they re teased by intriguing but elusive ideas by hints of thoughts that seem too vague to be expressed in words Edgar Allan Poe s advice is simple They should pick up their pens or he might add today power up their laptops Poe dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or subtle that they re beyond the compass of words For my own part he said in an article in Graham s Magazine I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it The mere act of writing Poe believed helps writers make their ideas not only clearer but more logical To use his phrase the process of writing contributes to the logicalization of thought Whenever he felt dissatisfied with a vague conception of the brain Poe said I resort forthwith to the pen for the purpose of obtaining through its aid the necessary form consequence and precision Today s advocates of freewriting would probably agree with Poe on this point Sometimes the best way to resolve a dilemma whether it s a writing dilemma or a thinking dilemma is simply to start writing In this digital age images are essential units of information and knowing how to use photography effectively is more important than ever Fortunately enrolling at the Hobbiton Institute of Photography is one of the easiest most cost effective ways to take your photography to the next level You ll be assigned a personal adviser have your work evaluated by experienced experts and receive insightful suggestions on how to make it better You ll also learn to think on your feet and develop the eye of a photographer You can pursue your passion with us and your photography will never be the same Many people use their cleverness to justify and excuse themselves for the messiness of their workspaces They say things like I know where everything is Or they say non humorous things such as A clean desk is a sign of a sick mind However people who say they know where everything is turn out to be using a large amount of their mental capacity and creative energies remembering where they placed things rather than doing the job If they worked in a well organized environment for any length of time they would be surprised at how much more productive they were If you have a tendency to attempt to explain a messy desk or work area challenge yourself to work with a clean desk for an entire day The result will amaze you Living things naturally return to a state of balance When we are disturbed by forces acting on us our inner machinery kicks in and returns us to a balanced state of equilibrium Homeostasis is the word we use to describe the ability of an organism to maintain internal equilibrium by adjusting its physiological processes Most of the systems in animal and human physiology are controlled by homeostasis We don t like to be off balance We tend to keep things in a stable condition This system operates at all levels Our blood stays the same temperature Except for extraordinary exceptions when people find ways to intervene using methods more powerful than our tendency to equilibrium our habits behaviors thoughts and our quality of life stay pretty much the same too All of us use the cultural knowledge we acquire as members of our own society to organize our perception and behavior Most of us are also naive realists we tend to believe our culture mirrors a reality shared by everyone But cultures are different and other people rarely behave or interpret experience according to our cultural plan For example an American anthropologist attempted to tell the classic story of Hamlet to Tiv elders in West Africa She believed that human nature is pretty much the same the whole world over at least the general plot and motivation of the great tragedy would always be clear But at each turn in the story when she told it the Tiv interpreted the events and motives in Hamlet using their own cultural knowledge The result was a very different version of the classic play The good news is that it s never too late to start building up muscle strength regardless of your age Ideally though it s best to start in your mid forties when muscle mass starts to decline significantly Once you ve started it can take just six weeks to see an improvement of up to percent in your muscle capabilities says Dr Ward Studies have found that intense programs of strength training can help even weak older people double their strength as well as enable them to walk faster and climb stairs more easily And muscle isn t all you gain strength training can help combat osteoarthritis depression and risk factors for heart disease and diabetes Standard English allows access to certain educational and economic opportunities which is the primary reason for teaching it Students realize this when they interview for a first job or when they plan for post high school education So what should teachers do when a student says I ain t got no pencil or brings some other nonstandard dialect into the classroom Opinions vary from rejection and correction to complete acceptance The approach most consistent with culturally responsive teaching is to first accept the dialect and then build on it For example when the student says I ain t got no pencil the teacher might say Oh you don t have a pencil What should you do then Although results won t be apparent immediately the long range benefits both for language development and attitudes toward school are worthwhile Emotional eaters manifest their problem in lots of different ways For many people one of the classic signs of emotional eating is night eating Night eaters are often eating in response to anxiety or to the emotional turmoil they ve experienced throughout the day Boredom and loneliness are also more likely to come to the surface when the rush of the day is done and the night stretches ahead Sometimes emotional eating is a reaction to a specific situation You had a bad day at work The kids have been so demanding that you are completely worn out You and your significant other are fighting It doesn t matter what the circumstances are the end result is that times out of you end up on the couch with a bowl of chips or bag of cookies in your hand telling yourself it s the only way you can relax Giving people the latitude and flexibility to use their judgment and apply their talents rapidly accelerates progress Send a message of respect and inspire people to be creative and use their individual talents toward the goals of the enterprise Empower people by letting them know that you believe in them and allowing them to take action Trusting people and empowering them also allows you to focus on the things you need to accomplish Ellyn McColgan says I used to say to people all the time I can help you figure out just about any problem you throw at me but is that really what you want from me They would look at me funny and say Not really I would say I think what you would like is to do a great job and then give me an opportunity to say Great job Then they would respond Yes that s true Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties rather than taking up the case of one party against another At times particularly in very complex situations the processes of advocacy and mediation can overlap perhaps with very problematic results as one loses clarity over his or her role It is therefore important if not essential to maintain a clear focus in undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure that the roles do not become blurred and therefore potentially counterproductive For example a mediator who takes sides is likely to lose all credibility as is an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position Since the beginning of time the mysterious nature of dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were messages from the other world Dreams have been regarded as prophetic communications which when properly decoded would enable us to foretell the future There is however absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory It is certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a traumatic event such as the threat of the loss of a loved one who is sick will dream about that loved one more than would otherwise be the case If the dreamer then calls and finds that the loved one has died it is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition of that death But this is a mistake It is simply a n coincidental correspondence between a situation about which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the event that one fears To prove the existence of premonitory dreams scientific evidence must be obtained We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of hits but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams missed To do a scientific study of dream prophecy we would need to establish some base of how commonly coincidental correspondences occur between dream and waking reality Until we have that evidence it is better to believe that the assumption is false My wife and I have enjoyed receiving your publication for years Unfortunately our jobs now have us both traveling most weeks and we simply cannot keep up with a daily paper So we would like to request that you stop delivery to our home If you have questions about this matter please leave a message at and either my wife or I will call you back as soon as we can Thank you for years of reliable delivery of a first rate newspaper If our situation changes we will call you to resume delivery In the meantime we will expect delivery to stop no later than the end of this week I have always taught my children that politeness learning and order are good things and that something good is to be desired and developed for its own sake But at school they learned and very quickly that children earn Nature Trail tickets for running the quarter mile track during lunch recess Or Lincoln Dollars for picking up trash on the playground or for helping a young child find the bathroom deeds that used to be called good citizenship Why is it necessary to buy the minimal cooperation of children with rewards and treats What disturbs me is the idea that good behavior must be reinforced with incentives Children must be taught to perform good deeds for their own sake not in order to receive stickers stars and candy bars Experienced writers invariably write in a climate of discussion Their writing is usually embedded in a context of others ideas and opinions Many writers especially in the academic community are directly responding to other writers a scientist reexamining the experimental procedures of other scientists a literary critic taking exception to a prevailing method of interpretation a sociologist offering an alternative explanation of a colleague s data a historian participating as respondent in a conference Such people are not writing in a vacuum Their ideas often originate in discussion their writing is a response to discussion and their papers are designed to stimulate further discussion Habitat diversity refers to the variety of places where life exists Each habitat is the home of numerous species most of which depend on that habitat When it disappears a vast number of species disappear as well More often an entire habitat does not completely disappear but instead is reduced gradually until only small patches remain This has happened to old growth forests and coastal wetlands in the United States and is now occurring in tropical forests throughout the world Elimination of all but small patches of habitat is especially damaging because it not only eliminates many local species but also threatens those species that depend on vast acreage for their survival Most people attack a new problem by relying heavily on the tools and skills that are most familiar to them While this approach can work well for problems that are similar to those previously solved it often fails and fails miserably when a new problem is particularly novel In this circumstance it is best to assume nothing and treat the problem as if you have never seen anything like it before In martial arts this sense of looking freshly at something is known as beginner s mind Beginners to any art don t know what is important and what is irrelevant so they try to absorb every detail Experienced martial artists use their experience as a filter to separate the essential from the irrelevant When that filter mistakenly screens out something essential then even seasoned masters can make mistakes You see the world as one big contest where everyone is competing against everybody else You feel that there is a set amount of good and bad fortune out there You believe that there is no way that everyone can have everything When other people fail you feel there s a better chance for you to succeed However there is not a limited supply of resources out there When one person wins everyone wins Every victory one person makes is a breakthrough for all Whenever an Olympic swimmer sets a new world record it inspires others to bring out the best within them and go beyond that achievement to set new records of human performance Whenever a geneticist unlocks new secrets of the DNA molecule it adds to our knowledge base and enables us to better the human condition Remember that life is a game where there are multiple winners University students in several of my seminar classes sat in a circle and each student took turns telling the others his or her name At the end of the round of introductions the students were asked to write down the names of as many other students as they could remember In almost every case students wrote down the names of students that were seated far away from them However surprisingly they weren t able to recall the names of students who were seated close to them This effect was worst for the students who sat on either side of them What was the reason for such findings The student who was next in line for an introduction was clearly on edge and after finishing his or her introduction he or she was preoccupied with calming his or her nerves The effect was clearly due to the social anxiety they experienced immediately before and after having to introduce themselves to the entire group Richard Dawkins and John Krebs argued that although in some circumstances it might be appropriate to describe animal signals as transferring information in many other perhaps most cases there would be such a conflict of interest between signaller and receiver that it is more accurate to describe the signaller as attempting to manipulate the receiver rather than just inform it For example an angler fish that dangles a worm like bit of skin in front of a small fish and catches it because the smaller fish snaps at the worm can certainly be said to have carried out a successful manipulation of its prey In this case if information has been transferred it is most definitely false Unlike the modern society the primitive society has less specialized knowledge to transmit and since its way of life is enacted before the eyes of all it has no need to create a separate institution of education such as the school Instead the child acquires the heritage of his culture by observing and imitating adults in such activities as rituals hunts festivals cultivation and harvesting As a result there is little or none of that alienation of young from old so marked in modern industrial societies A further reason for this alienation in modern societies is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes less to his direct experience and more to the experience of his culture than does primitive man Clearly his debt to culture will vary with the nature of his education Hence the contemporary child must travel much further than the offspring of primitive man to acquire the world view of his elders He is therefore that much more removed from the adults of his society Many people believe that it is critical to share similar if not identical beliefs and values with someone with whom they have a relationship While this may seem preferable it is far from mandatory Individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds have learned to overlook their differences and live harmonious loving lives together I ve seen people from opposite ends of the spectrum economically and politically that ended up in happy lasting marriages I ve seen couples from different ethnic groups merge into harmonious relationships and I ve seen people from different religions come together for a strong lasting bond Furthermore many good friends have little in common except a warm loving feeling of respect and rapport That s the only essential thing People who enjoy the best relationships with others who live life with the least frustration regarding their differences have learned that differences are to be expected a fact of life This understanding must go beyond a mere intellectual I know we re all different You must truly own this idea and incorporate it into your daily life The way I see it we have only two realistic choices We can resist the principle of separate realities and remain frustrated and angry over the fact that no one seems to conform to our way of thinking or we can strive to understand what in Eastern philosophy is called the way of things Separate realities is the way things really are Everyone is unique and has different gifts to offer When we look for these gifts we will surely find them and in doing so we will open the door to a world of personal growth Upon receiving your last letter I rushed to look up the word flattering in the dictionary I was shocked to find out that it could imply something negative which I certainly did not mean I should have used some word like complimentary instead For that I would like to ask for the kindness in your heart to forgive my unintended offense If you knew me well you would know that I am shameless enough to take all compliments at their face value and not to think that they might be mere flattery I just did not know what the word really implied I hope that you no longer feel hurt or uncomfortable in any way as a result of our correspondence Imagine that you are in a meeting Your party and the other party are sitting across a table You ask a question on a particular subject and the answer is unsatisfactory What would be the best response It is none at all So if you are seeking more information or a different kind of information ask for it by remaining silent When there is a long pause in the conversation people feel an overwhelming need to fill it If someone has finished speaking and you do not play along by taking up your end of the dialog that person will automatically start to elaborate Eventually they may say what you want to hear A forest fire in Brazil affects the weather in Moscow by creating huge dust clouds that eventually float over Russia Every element in an ecosystem depends on every other element even the so called nonliving elements such as minerals oxygen and sunlight Yes light is an integral element of all life The sun is food for many of earth s life forms Physicists speak of photons of light as being interchangeable When the light from an object hits a person only some of it bounces off Most of the photons are absorbed into the person Its energy becomes that person s energy This is how incredible interdependence is everything is constantly becoming everything else In practical situations where there is no room for error we have learned to avoid vagueness in communication A fire chief for example needs to issue his orders with absolute clarity In imaginative situations however there is the danger that too much specificity can limit your imagination Let s suppose that the same fire chief has asked you to paint a picture on the side of his firehouse If he tells you what he wants it to look like right down to the last detail he has not given you any room for your imagination However if the assignment were stated somewhat vaguely then you would have more room to think and be more creative Although a speech can be effective all the words in the world cannot measure up to the example of a leader especially in communicating new behaviors and values There is often no more effective way to help people understand the message than to have it modeled for them by the manager Words can yield a variety of interpretations in terms of the kind of behaviors people think they mean But a manager s actions provide a clear model of exactly the kind of behavior required Managers who want people to take a more team based approach with their people for example will almost certainly get better results by taking a more team based approach themselves rather than just by making a speech on teamwork Young children rarely think of their art as personal property Often they throw it away or give it away This suggests that much of the value of art for a child consists in making it Interestingly art in tribal societies is frequently abandoned after it has served its purpose The focus is on the magical expressive and social value of the act of making Some contemporary artists share this feeling but they are also caught up in the system of art exhibition the selling of their art and the requirements of an art market This results in a tension in the art world that is largely unresolved the tension between art as a satisfying mode of expression and art as a precious collectible object between the experience of making and the experience of owning The age of is not without its charm One of the more amusing aspects of this age is the child s often vivid imagination expressed most strikingly in his enjoyment of imaginary companions Though some people have felt that only the lonely play with imaginary playmates our research makes it very evident that it is often the highly superior and imaginative child who invents these creatures They are very real to him very important and we can assure you quite harmless Even though it may be annoying to have to lay a place at dinner or keep an extra seat in the family automobile for his friend who exists only in your child s imagination it is probably well worthwhile How can you create closeness when the two of you are hundreds of miles apart How can you make the person you are talking to on the phone feel special when you cannot pat their back or give them a little hug The answer is simple Just use your caller s name far more often than you would in person In fact shower your conversations with his or her name Saying a person s name too often in face to face conversation sounds manipulative However on the phone the effect is dramatically different If you heard someone say your name even if you were being pushed around in a big noisy crowd you would pay attention and listen Many years ago psychologists performed an experiment in which they put a number of people in a room alone except for a ring toss set It was one of those children s toys with a short wooden post held upright on the floor and a bunch of round rings The subjects were left alone to amuse themselves as best they could As expected with time to kill they began trying to toss the rings around the post What the psychologists discovered was that most of the people moved far enough away from the post so that tossing the rings around it was challenging but not so difficult as to be totally frustrating In other words they deliberately positioned themselves between frustration on the one hand and boredom on the other The process of alternately producing and relieving tension was what made the activity stimulating A friend of mine and his wife were in Hawaii standing on a beach watching a beautiful sunset hardly able to believe how magnificent the sight was A woman approached them and overheard my friend s wife say I can t believe how beautiful this is While walking away from the spectacular display the woman said You should have seen it in Tahiti When your attention is not on the present moment but on something else you will tend to compare even good experiences with others as the Tahiti traveler did or you will wonder about future experiences instead of enjoying the present one and regret past experiences because they are already over But as you learn to bring your attention back to the here and now life will come alive again providing the enjoyment and satisfaction it was meant to Thus when you live in the present moment one of the nice things that happens to you is that ordinary everyday life takes on a new significance Taking walks watching a sunset gardening reading a book all begin to feel special When your attention is brought back to the here and now you engage in life rather than think about life If you are worrying about money when you are away your enjoyment will suffer Plan your budget in advance to give yourself time to research the costs fully If you cannot get confirmed prices get as many estimates as you can Note the best price and the worst price and budget in between the two Ideally the budgeted figures will work out just about right If they don t you will have to use your emergency fund to cover basic expenses such as food transport and accommodation and there will be less money available for an unexpected situation that necessitates a sudden change of plan So be sure to make your budget realistic so that you can be confident that you will be able to pay for all aspects of the trip Many people believe that they will be free of their anger if they express it and that their tears will release their pain This belief derives from a nineteenth century understanding of emotions and it is no truer than the flat earth It sees the brain as a steam kettle in which negative feelings build up pressure But no psychologist has ever succeeded in proving the unburdening effects of the supposed safety valves of tears and anger On the contrary over forty years ago controlled studies showed that fits of anger are more likely to intensify anger and that tears can drive us still deeper into depression Our heads do not resemble steam kettles and our brains involve a much more complicated system than can be accounted for by images taken from nineteenth century technology Knowing when something happened is important Understanding why historic events took place is also important To do this historians often turn to geography Weather patterns the water supply and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there For example to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization you must look at the geography of Egypt Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River which flooded each year depositing soil on its banks The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities That meant everyone did not have to farm so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization Nowadays we can enjoy athletic competition of every kind without leaving our homes It is the fun that comes from cheering on our team and celebrating its skills while complaining about the opposing team s good luck But some individuals sit and watch a football game or tennis match without cheering for anyone or any team They are not willing to risk the possible disappointment of picking the loser so they give up the possible joy of picking the winner They live in the world of neutrality Don t be one of them Sure your team might lose But then again your team might win Either way your spectator experience will have been a fun one and you will have avoided being merely a passive observer Old Hawk gestured up at the tall old cottonwood It was so large that a grown man could not put his arms around it This tree he said has stood guard over our family all its life Strength is what I feel each time I look at it Yet there have been moments when its great strength was also its weakness That s hard to believe Jeremy said It s the biggest tree for miles around Old Hawk pointed at the chokecherry trees in a dry river bed not far away Look there he said those chokecherry trees are small and weak in comparison to this cottonwood But when you were a child they survived a storm without losing a branch This old cottonwood on the other hand lost several branches It stood up to the storm but it could not bend with the wind the way the chokecherry trees could The specific combinations of foods in a cuisine and the ways they are prepared constitute a deep reservoir of accumulated wisdom about diet and health and place In Latin America for example corn is traditionally eaten with beans each plant is deficient in an essential amino acid that happens to be abundant in the other so together corn and beans form a balanced diet in the absence of meat Similarly corn in Latin America is traditionally ground or soaked with limestone which makes available a B vitamin in the corn the absence of which would otherwise lead to a deficiency disease Very often when a society adopts a new food without the food culture surrounding it as happened when corn first came to Europe Africa and Asia people get sick The context in which a food is eaten can be nearly as important as the food itself Processing a TV message is much more like the all at once processing of the ear than the linear processing of the eye reading a printed page According to McLuhan television is fundamentally an acoustic medium To make this point clear he invited people to try a simple experiment First turn the sound down on the TV set for one minute during your favorite program Now for another minute adjust the TV set so that you can hear the sound but you can t see any picture Which condition was more frustrating Which condition gave you less information McLuhan believed that people who tried this little exercise would invariably report more frustration in the condition where the picture was visible but the sound was inaudible Most people have a vase or two in a cupboard but lots of things can be turned into stylish containers for a flower arrangement so before you rush out to buy anything look around your own home For instance goldfish bowls look stunning filled with flower heads or petals magnifying their contents Wine milk mineral water or olive oil bottles look particularly good with one or two stems in them Try a collection of bottles in various shapes and sizes lined up on a shelf or grouped on a table An old teapot which has lost its lid becomes an ideal container for a bunch of roses picked from the garden Everywhere in the world the issue of how to manage urban growth poses the highest stakes complex policy decisions and strongly heated conflicts in the public area The contrast between Western Europe and America is particularly sharp In Western Europe steep gasoline taxes investment policies favoring built up areas over undeveloped greenfields continuous investment in public transportation and other policies have produced relatively compact cities Cities in Western Europe tend to be economically healthy compared with their suburbs By contrast in the United States cheap gas massive highway investment policies that favor construction on the edges of cities and heavy reliance on property taxes to fund public schools have encouraged much more car reliant and spread out urban areas where eight in ten Americans now live It is my great pleasure to inform you that your sons and daughters have completed all the academic requirements over the last three years of study at Hutt High School We feel as if the day they entered our school were yesterday and now they will proudly receive their graduation certificates Not unlike many successful graduates in our long history your children will go out into the world and successfully participate in the fields of politics economics culture and education The graduation ceremony will be held next Friday in Hutt High School s Assembly Hall On behalf of the school I would like to extend our invitation to you and your family I look forward to meeting you there We have to ask ourselves a question What kind of world will our children have to live in Will they have air to breathe and food to eat These are among the basic questions that were addressed at the first world meeting on the environment attended by more than world leaders and other scientists newspeople and citizens concerned These complex problems can no longer be solved by individual countries Nations of the world must act together if we are to develop answers that will give a safe and healthy world to our children World leaders should have the vision to protect our environment There is healing power in flowers and in trees fresh air and sweet smelling soil Just walking through a garden or for that matter seeing one out your window can lower blood pressure reduce stress and ease pain Get out there and start digging and the benefits multiply While it may be basic and even old fashioned using gardening as a health care tool is blossoming New or remodeled hospitals and nursing homes increasingly come equipped with healing gardens where patients and staff can get away from barren indoor surroundings Many also offer patients a chance to get their hands dirty and their minds engaged in caring for plants Most of us buy our food from supermarkets In fact many of us don t even get as far as the supermarket but make our choices at the click of a mouse We have abandoned our relationship with the food we eat and with the people who produce our food Is it any wonder that our children don t know where food comes from Is it any wonder that we re tired overweight irritable and low It is important to be mindful about every single aspect of purchasing food Try not to race through your shopping In my hometown nobody would buy a melon without feeling it and smelling it and nobody would dream of buying a chicken without knowing which farm it came from and what it ate A status symbol is something usually an expensive or rare object that indicates a high social status for its owner What is considered a status symbol will differ among countries based on the states of their economic and technological development and common status symbols will change over time Status symbols can indicate the cultural values of a society Let s take some examples In a society that cherishes honor or bravery a battle wound would be more of a status symbol In a commercial society where having money or wealth is most important things that can be brought by wealth such as cars houses or fine clothing are considered status symbols And in a society where people craze for beauty the condition of one s skin and body can be a status symbol The ability to sympathize with others reflects the multiple nature of the human being his potentialities for many more selves and kinds of experience than any one being could express This may be one of the things that enable us to seek through literature an enlargement of our experience Although we may see some characters as outside ourselves that is we may not identify with them completely we are nevertheless able to enter into their behavior and their emotions Thus the youth may identify with the aged one gender with the other and a reader of a particular limited social background with members of a different class or a different period Newton was the first to point out that light is colorless and that consequently color has to occur inside our brains He wrote The waves themselves are not colored Since his time we have learned that light waves are characterized by different frequencies of vibration When they enter the eye of an observer they set off a chain of neurochemical events the end product of which is an internal mental image that we call color The essential point here is What we perceive as color is not made up of color Although an apple may appear red its atoms are not themselves red If we want to describe our society in terms of age we may come up with four age groups childhood adolescence maturity and old age We take it for granted that people of different ages behave differently For example we feel that a man in his thirties should act his age and not behave like an adolescent or an old man Equally we expect that as they go through life people of the same age will in some ways understand each other better than people of different ages All this is part of expected ways of behaving in our social life but it is not something that we can apply in formal institutions governed by hard and fast rules With the rise of the social sciences and especially the anthropology of the s and thereafter words like savage and primitive began to disappear from the vocabulary of cultural studies along with the notion that the people who had once borne these labels represented a biologically less evolved form of humanity Medical science could find no difference in the brains of the former primitives to account for their different behavior colonists necessarily observed that yesterday s savage might be today s shopkeeper soldier or servant As humanity began to look more like a family of potential equals Westerners had to accept that the behavior found in native cultures was not the distinctive feature of savage otherness but the expression of a capacity that may exist for better or for worse in all of us Thank you for sending your poems to this publishing house I have had the opportunity to look them over and I feel that they show considerable promise despite your youth and lack of experience in this genre There is still much room for development however and I am afraid they are not yet appropriate for publishing in any of our current poetry journals You indicate in your cover letter that you intend to follow a literary career Please allow me to offer my best wishes for your future literary efforts All travellers should ensure they have adequate travel insurance before they depart A suitable insurance policy should provide coverage for medical expenses arising from illness or accident prior to or during their vacation loss of vacation money and cancellation of the holiday Please keep your insurance policy and emergency contact details with you at all times Before departure you will be required to provide your tour leader with a copy of your insurance policy covering the period of travel Without this information you will not be allowed to travel with the group Every society needs heroes and every society has them Some heroes shine in the face of great adversity performing amazing deeds in difficult situations other heroes do their work quietly unnoticed by most of us but making a difference in the lives of other people Whatever their type heroes are selfless people who perform extraordinary acts The true mark of heroes lies not necessarily in the result of their actions but in what they are willing to do for others and for their chosen causes Even if they fail their determination lives on to inspire the rest of us Their glory lies not in their achievements but in their sacrifices Over the past twenty years I ve asked thousands of people Where are you when you get your best ideas The most frequent answers are resting in bed walking in nature listening to music while driving in my car and relaxing in the bath People rarely get their best ideas at work What is so special about walking in the woods or resting in bed Solitude and relaxation Most people have their best ideas when they are relaxed and by themselves Leonardo da Vinci once wrote If you are alone you are completely yourself but if you are accompanied by a single companion you are half yourself Every mother and father wants to raise a child with a strong moral character We want our children to know good from bad and right from wrong We hope they ll learn to behave morally and ethically and grow up to be honest and considerate In short we want our children to develop a conscience a powerful inner voice that will keep them on the right path But a conscience does not develop by itself so the job of building one is ours It s a process parents need to work on day after day and year after year We need to constantly distinguish right from wrong and to model appropriate behavior Eventually our children will fully accept our messages and they will become the essence of their character The story starts in the world of Homer where the stormy skies and the dark seas were ruled by the mythical gods Every advance in human understanding since then has been made by brave individuals daring to step into the unknown darkness and to break free from accepted ways of thinking Most of those steps were small and difficult but a few were brilliant and beautiful As Gustave Flaubert wrote Among those who go to sea there are the explorers who discover new worlds adding continents to the Earth and stars to the heavens they are the masters the great the eternally shining It is those explorers through their unceasing trial and error who have paved the way for us to follow Most of us believe that we can trust in technology to solve our problems Whatever problem you name you can also name some hoped for technological solution Some of us have faith that we shall solve our dependence on fossil fuels by developing new technologies for hydrogen engines wind energy or solar energy Some of us have faith that we shall solve our food problems with genetically modified crops newly or soon to be developed Those with such faith assume that the new technologies will ultimately succeed without harmful side effects However there is no basis for believing that technology will not cause new and unanticipated problems while solving the problems that it previously produced People who run sports camps think of the children first They do their best to create enjoyable and protective environments in which the children feel comfortable and safe Unfortunately some sports coaches in the camps occasionally become over enthusiastic in their desire to help the children excel As a result they put pressure on them to perform at high levels win at all costs and keep playing even when they get hurt This no pain no gain approach is extremely stressful and leads to unnecessary injuries Parents should therefore take care when they send their children to a sports camp and should talk with the sports coaches to see if they will respect the children s wishes For the past years you have been a valued and respected employee of this company Since you started in the mail room in your contributions to this firm have been invaluable Your skills led to your being promoted to executive secretary in Thus it is safe to say that without your contributions over the years we would not be as successful as we have been On behalf of all the executives we wish you well and hope you enjoy your well earned retirement Ever since the coming of television there has been a rumor that the novel is dying if not already dead Indeed print oriented novelists seem doomed to disappear as electronic media and computer games are becoming more influential Nowadays many young people seem to prefer surfing the Internet to reading books And often what they seek is not so much profound knowledge as quick information One may wonder if literary fiction is destined to become an old fashioned genre to be preserved in a museum like an extinct species Painting restorers are highly trained in their techniques but they would have to be the original painter to know exactly what to do with the work at hand Technical aspects of the work such as dirt removal are quite straightforward What is important is to bring a painting back to an artist s original intent In order to do so they have to decide if they should add something to the painting or leave it as it is They admit it is extremely difficult to determine what should and should not be retouched Our goal is to respect the artist s intent but at the same time to make it a visually coherent work of art says Michael Duffy of the Museum of Modern Art in New York You may have had this experience A person calls you on the telephone Apparently assuming you will recognize her voice she does not provide any verbal content which would help you identify her For example you pick up the phone and say Hello and the voice on the other end says Hi how are you doing At this point you realize you dont know who it is So you try to extend the conversation without admitting your ignorance hoping some verbal clues will be given or that you ll eventually recognize the caller s voice As a result you say something like Fine What have you been up to The adult forgets the troubles of his youth Comparing the remembered carefree past with his immediate problems the mature man thinks that troubles belong only to the present The twelve year old the adult thinks does not worry about salary or professional advancement When the roof leaks only the parent worries about what contractor to employ or about how he will repair it himself To the adult then childhood is a time of freedom The child however wishes always to be a man He finds freedom in the future To him adulthood is a time of wealth and his father or mother never needs to worry about saving to buy a bicycle How much one can earn is important of course but there are other equally important considerations neglect of which may produce frustration in later years Where there is genuine interest one may work diligently without even realizing it and in such situations success follows More important than success which generally means promotion or an increase in salary is the happiness which can only be found in doing work that one enjoys for its own sake and not merely for the rewards it brings Even our most highly educated guesses often go disastrously wrong Albert Einstein remarked There is no chance that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable Why is predicting the future so difficult Would it be smart not to try to guess what s coming next Not predicting the future would be like driving a car without looking through the windshield We desperately need people who can foretell the future They help us narrow the infinity of possible futures down to one or at least a few We look at the present and see the present they see the seeds of the future They are our advance scouts going secretly over the border to bring back priceless information to help the world to come Moles are dark spots on human skin They can vary in color from light to dark brown or black Almost everyone has at least one mole According to ancient superstitions moles reveal a person s character For example a mole on one s nose means that he or she is strong willed and trustworthy Moles are also believed to foretell the future Having a mole over one s right eyebrow means he or she will be lucky with money and have a successful career A mole on the hand however is the most desired It forecasts talent health and happiness Michelangelo looked at a block of marble and saw a man Elffers looks at a lemon and sees a pig Growing up in Holland he was taught to clear his plate playing with food was forbidden As an adult the artist visited Japan where he recalls food was almost too beautiful and without humor Food should be a joy With his edible produce sculptures Elffers hopes to share that joy If you give people permission to see the pig in the lemon they will forever see animals in fruit or vegetables he says Americans carve pumpkins but they never use the stem It s such an expressive nose He urges pumpkin buyers to create their own zoos this Halloween Elffers says Shop with an open mind The claim that we have recently entered the information age is misleading Flooded by cellphones the Internet and television we incorrectly imagine that our ancestors inhabited an innocent world where the news did not travel far beyond the village It may not be valid to assume that the media make our time distinct from the past because we know relatively little about how information was shared in the past In fact the Olympics celebrate the memory of the Greek soldier who brought the news of the Athenian victory over the Persians Most of us could come up with many other examples message drums smoke signals church bells ship flags But their primitiveness would only confirm our sense that we live in a fundamentally different world one of constant instant access to information All ages have had a means of sharing information What makes our time distinct is not the density of the data we take in It is the technology that does the transmitting Thanks to satellites we can find out instantly about events that occur on the other side of the world It usually took five weeks for Benjamin Franklin in Paris to receive a letter sent from Philadelphia But the news was still new and surprising to people there Perhaps the greatest thing about being a devoted operagoer is that there is so much room for growth Although you have heard an opera once you can still hear it five or twenty times more I have heard at least twenty performances of my favorite operas and I would happily hear them twenty more times With each rehearing you refine what you know The better you know an opera the more you will be challenged by the ideas of new singers conductors directors and designers Your first experience with Rigoletto and Tosca is only your introduction to those masterpieces Each time you hear a different singer in any of the key roles you are hearing a new interpretation Even the same singer will vary on two different occasions Artists grow and change in their approach to a character based on their own life experiences and their moods For example I saw a famous soprano from Eastern Europe sing Tosca twice within ten months The first time was a good honest performance that pleased the audience The second was impressive Between the performances the singer s husband had suddenly died The love scenes in the second performance seemed much more moving and her response to the death of her lover was undeniably charming A small number of people have recognized the value of wild plants in Korea They are fascinated by the beauty of these plants and have been motivated to conserve them after discovering the tragic realities these plants face Because of indifference to and destruction of their natural habitats some wild plants confront an uncertain future Given this situation these people have striven to conserve the wild plants growing in Korea They have taught the public to value plant species and launched efforts to preserve wild plants for generations to come Thanks to their efforts more Koreans now understand the full value of their precious wild plants Reading comprehension involves one s knowledge of the world For instance let s think about what stopped the car in the following two sentences The policeman raised his hand and stopped the car and Superman raised his hand and stopped the car Your probable answer to this question is legal authority in the first sentence and magical power in the second one Remember however that neither legal authority nor magical power is stated in either sentence Then how do you know the answer You know it because you use your background knowledge of the policeman and Superman in order to understand these two sentences My wife and I were at a friend s house recently We noticed our friend talking on the phone while simultaneously answering the door checking on dinner and changing her baby s diaper Many of us do the same when we are speaking to someone and our mind is elsewhere When this happens we not only lose much of the enjoyment of what we are doing but we also become far less focused and effective To take this to an extreme imagine yourself driving down the highway while shaving drinking coffee or reading the newspaper You may be inviting an accident When doing anything just focus on what you are doing Erik Erikson well known for his psycho social development theory says that the first issue an infant faces right after birth is trust He emphasizes that trust is the most important factor in the child s developing personality and love quality not quantity is the key According to Erikson basic trust involves having the courage to let go of the familiar and take a step toward the unknown Studies suggest that when a healthy trust is formed from the start of life it leads one to moral honest balanced conduct in relations with others Market researchers often comment that the elderly think of themselves as being much younger than they actually are In fact research confirms the popular wisdom that age is more a state of mind than of body The level of a person s mental outlook and activity has much more to do with length and quality of life than does actual age A recent study suggests that perceived age may be a more reliable predictor of marketing success on the gray market than actual age For this reason many marketers focus on perceived age in marketing campaigns Im glad to hear that you re going to Korea to study the Korean language and culture You sound a little worried but I think living in a foreign country can be more exciting than you might imagine I myself had a hard time at first However as time passed I found myself doing better when I concentrated more on improving my language ability and making friends I learned how to play a traditional Korean musical instrument the j anggu which helped me make friends more easily You re one of the brightest people I know so Im sure you ll do just fine Nature seems to be constantly changing If we observe nature closely however we discover that there is a constant tension between change and balance In the case of human beings the general shape and size of our body remains relatively constant while the cells within it are continually being replaced Likewise the forest remains a forest even while individual trees and grasses are removed by death and replaced by birth The dead bodies of organisms in the forest are broken down and turned into soil which in turn nourishes other organisms The elements of nature are continually changing but nature itself remains constant An increasing emphasis on the value of time is changing consumers behavior A recent survey has found that shoppers want more time for themselves and one way to get it is to spend less time shopping Because of this change shop owners are changing store designs to make shopping and consumer service easier For example to help busy shoppers race through the store companies now display floor plans in many different places throughout the store Also they have made their stores bigger to minimize time spent shopping In making a successful school we must consider the relationships among the people involved in the school community Teachers need to know their students well in order to be able to teach them effectively In addition teachers must maintain a good relationship with the parents who are also an important part of the total community In a community built on trust and openness where teachers students and parents show respect for each other students feel secure and can develop the self confidence which makes learning and personal growth possible When students are drawn into meaningful relationships with their teachers and other adults they are better able to see them as real people This affects their whole attitude toward school and learning In such an environment teachers feel valued and supported Parents feel included As a result they are more likely to contribute to the improvement of the school and the learning of the students All members of the school community feel as though they belong and can make a positive contribution to the school Our parents cast long shadows over our lives and we become aware of their existence when we are infants Parents first teach us essential ways of living by cautioning Don t touch or It s not nice to do that We may think that we learn these lessons through independent efforts but it s not the way we obtain them at all It is our parents who have given us our sense of right and wrong our understanding of love and our knowledge of who we are As we grow up we see them less and less We leave their homes and we start new families of our own So sometimes we think that we can walk in the sun free of the shadows But still the shadows have not gone We carry their being with us all our lives in the sounds of our voices the look and feel of our skin and the warmth of our hands and our hearts It is only when they are gone and we never see them that we find that they and we are indivisible In fact we have not been able to separate ourselves from them our whole lives long The shadows are still there but they have never really blocked the light at all This government has emphasized excellence in business It recognizes that the economy must remain strong and is willing to provide whatever is needed in order to achieve this excellence However it hasn t fully recognized the importance of the arts especially the performing arts The performing arts also desire excellence but in order to achieve it they need financial help Without the government s support the performing arts cannot survive This will affect other areas of culture including film If the government doesn t support the performing arts this country will lose much of the heart and soul of its people Few people are aware that is an important year in the history of the Korean press In that year the newspaper was first published in Korea in an effort to educate the people and bring necessary changes to the country Three times a month it brought the readers news about the country and the rest of the world A year later the newspaper was discontinued for a while due to a fire It had to close in because of lack of money In spite of its short life it changed forever how people got their news in Korea I visit a family in Africa The woman of the house tells me that she hopes to learn to read so that she can study a handbook on raising children In Japan I am invited to the apartment of a young couple Their daughter talks about her first grade teacher In Egypt I am aboard a houseboat on the Nile The owner talks about a recent film Don t these topics strike a familiar note My experience as a traveler has taught me that despite differences in dress language and living conditions people all over the world are very much the same People are often considered to be rude unintentionally Absorbed in their own thoughts people do not see the motions of someone trying to greet them They may walk right by a friend without noticing him or her Others indeed do not see they are without their contact lenses or are quite nearsighted It is important to take into consideration absent mindedness or poor eyesight before believing that a friend is actually disregarding you One friendship I know of was tense for months because a woman thought she was being ignored by a friend who simply was not wearing her glasses and couldn t see beyond her nose Those who cannot make a success in their business or profession are the ones whose concentration is poor Many of those who have succeeded in life owe this to the fact that their concentration is good If one is an artist with the help of concentration one can produce wonderful works If one is a scientist one can achieve great results in science If one is a poet poetry will be easy to write However qualified a person may be he will not be able to make the best use of his qualifications without concentration He can hardly be called qualified at all Would a modern music composer be your first choice for a hero Or would you think of the painter of a contemporary masterpiece If you are like most people the answer to both questions is no More likely a sports hero or a movie star would be your first choice It seems that the worlds of contemporary art and music have failed to offer people works that reflect human achievements People therefore have lost interest in modern arts and have turned to sports stars and other popular figures to find their role models In many countries around the world narrowmindedness religious impatience greed and fear have turned into crises that have taken the lives of millions Many struggles such as rich versus poor are fought under deeply held beliefs But given the destructive results do these beliefs make sense How often in fact do we stop to think about what we believe One of the major problems we face both as individuals and as a society is simplistic thinking or the failure to think at all It isn t just a problem perhaps it is the problem Have you ever hurt another person If so get in touch with the person you wronged and ask for forgiveness in all sincerity You must apologize for that hurt Promise yourself now to carry it out immediately Even after many years it s still possible to find people If the person has died or really can t be found you can make a contribution in some way to help others who have suffered from similar acts If your determination is firm clear and sincere then you will be able to put that emotion and memory aside and find peace of mind Once a week write a heartfelt letter Taking a few minutes each week to do so does many things for you Picking up a pen slows you down long enough to remember the beautiful people in your life The act of sitting down to write helps to fill your life with appreciation Once you decide to try this you ll probably be amazed at how many people appear on your list The purpose of your letter is very simple to express love and gratitude Don t worry if you re not good at writing letters If you can t think of much to say start with short little notes like Dear Jasmine How lucky I am to have friends like you in my life I am truly blessed and I wish you all the happiness and joy that life can bring Love Richard Not only does the act of writing a note like this focus your attention on what s right in your life but the person receiving it will be touched and grateful Often this simple action starts a chain of loving actions whereby the person receiving your letter may decide to do the same thing to someone else or perhaps will act and feel more loving toward others Dear Future Pilots We are very excited to announce that we will offer the Summer Aviation Flight Camp for student pilot certificates It will be held from July to August at O Ryan Flight School The summer camp will include programs in which participants can receive flight instruction from professional pilots go on field trips try flight simulators and do a lot more Because of the aviation regulation for student pilots the camp is limited to participants over years old Please see the attached document for registration and tuition information If you have further questions about the camp please contact the coordinator at Sincerely Todd O Ryan Director Learning a certain concept such as molecules requires more than just a single exposure to the idea If a student is going to remember a science concept he or she should experience it multiple times and in various contexts That is one of the strengths of the learning cycle the students have direct experience with the concept then they talk about it and then they have even more direct experience Reading watching videos and listening to others thoughts contribute to a more solid understanding of the concept This suggests more than repetition Each event allows the student to examine the concept from a different perspective Ultimately this will lead to a substantive useful understanding of the complexities and nuances of the concept The twenty first century is the age of information and knowledge It is a century that is characterized by knowledge as the important resource that gains competitive advantage for companies To acquire all these knowledge and information organizations must rely on the data that they store Data the basic element is gathered daily from different input sources Information is extracted or learned from these sources of data and this captured information is then transformed into knowledge that is eventually used to trigger actions or decisions By and large organizations do not have any problem of not having enough data because most organizations are rich with data The problem however is that many organizations are poor in information and knowledge This fact translates into one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations how to transform raw data into information and eventually into knowledge which if exploited correctly provides the capabilities to predict customers behaviour and business trends In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first manuals teaching table manners to the offspring of aristocrats It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa and many others produced in different European countries In a variety of ways and meanings these are all instruments intended to define or distinguish who is in from who is out separating the participants from the ostracized It is for this reason that manuals of good manners addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative reference to the peasant who behaves badly who doesn t know what the rules are and for this reason is excluded from the lordly table Food etiquette had become a sign of social barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down Racial and ethnic relations in the United States are better today than in the past but many changes are needed before sports are a model of inclusion and fairness The challenges today are different from the ones faced twenty years ago and experience shows that when current challenges are met a new social situation is created in which new challenges emerge For example once racial and ethnic segregation is eliminated and people come together they must learn to live work and play with each other despite diverse experiences and cultural perspectives Meeting this challenge requires a commitment to equal treatment plus learning about the perspectives of others understanding how they define and give meaning to the world and then determining how to form and maintain relationships while respecting differences making compromises and supporting one another in the pursuit of goals that may not always be shared None of this is easy and challenges are never met once and for all time After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in made the term sustainability widely known around the world the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as pro environmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior It became a public relations term an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm But then in a decade or so some governments industries educational institutions and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing green products but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions Aristotle did not think that all human beings should be allowed to engage in political activity in his system women slaves and foreigners were explicitly excluded from the right to rule themselves and others Nevertheless his basic idea that politics is a unique collective activity that is directed at certain common goals and ends still resonates today But which ends Many thinkers and political figures since the ancient world have developed different ideas about the goals that politics can or should achieve This approach is known as political moralism For moralists political life is a branch of ethics or moral philosophy so it is unsurprising that there are many philosophers in the group of moralistic political thinkers Political moralists argue that politics should be directed toward achieving substantial goals or that political arrangements should be organized to protect certain things Among these things are political values such as justice equality liberty happiness fraternity or national self determination At its most radical moralism produces descriptions of ideal political societies known as Utopias named after English statesman and philosopher Thomas More s book Utopia published in which imagined an ideal nation Utopian political thinking dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato s book the Republic but it is still used by modern thinkers such as Robert Nozick to explore ideas Some theorists consider Utopian political thinking to be a bad undertaking since it has led in the past to justifications of totalitarian violence However at its best Utopian thinking is part of a process of striving toward a better society and many thinkers use it to suggest values to be pursued or protected Dear staff Next Monday Nature s Beauty Gardens will have the pleasure of hosting very important guests for the annual Toddler Trek event We hope that this will be fun educational and most importantly safe for the toddlers Parents and children are going to spend time enjoying outdoor activities and having a picnic lunch It is therefore very important to check the garden for potential dangers Managers of each department must make sure that all dangerous equipment and machinery are safely stored Also for the safety of our guests at this event garden chemicals will not be used anywhere in Nature s Beauty Gardens Thank you for your cooperation in this safety check and for helping to make this year s Toddler Trek event the best one yet Best regards Laura Alfaro Managing Director We say to ourselves There is plenty of time I ll manage somehow or other when the time comes for action We are rather proud of our ability to meet emergencies So we do not plan and take precautions to prevent emergencies from arising It is too easy to drift through school and college taking the traditional conventional studies that others take following the lines of least resistance electing snap courses and going with the crowd It is too easy to take the attitude First I will get my education and develop myself and then I will know better what I am fitted to do for a life work And so we drift driven by the winds of circumstance tossed about by the waves of tradition and custom Eventually most men find they must be satisfied with any port in a storm Sailors who select a port because they are driven to it have scarcely one chance in a thousand of dropping anchor in the right one Internet entrepreneurs are creating job search products and bringing them online regularly Within the past few years new Internet based businesses have come online that help people find internships complete online classes tailored to individual employer job applications or find volunteer work that will lead to full time employment Job mastery will mean keeping up with the rapidly evolving tools available on the Internet It should be noted though that no development in the Internet job age has reduced the importance of the most basic job search skill self knowledge Even in the Internet age the job search starts with identifying individual job skills sector interests and preferred workplace environment and interests Richard Bolles best selling job search book first published in had as its central theme the self inventory of skills and workplace preferences This self inventory continues to be the starting point for any job search today no matter what the Internet technology involved The term biological control has been used at times in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products This has been spectacularly successful in many instances with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems and or pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems On the other hand this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems In these situations the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agro ecosystem setting Thus importation programs to date are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved According to the individualist form of rhetoric about science still much used for certain purposes discoveries are made in laboratories They are the product of inspired patience of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind Moreover they speak for themselves or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts Any scientist who announces a so called discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker The norms of scientific communication presuppose that nature does not speak unambiguously and that knowledge isn t knowledge unless it has been authorized by disciplinary specialists A scientific truth has little standing until it becomes a collective product What happens in somebody s laboratory is only one stage in its construction In some subject areas topics build on one another in a hierarchical fashion so that a learner must almost certainly master one topic before moving to the next For example an elementary school student should probably master principles of addition before moving to multiplication because multiplication is an extension of addition Similarly a medical student must have expertise in human anatomy before studying surgical techniques It s difficult to perform an appendectomy if you can t find the appendix Vertical transfer refers to such situations A learner acquires new knowledge or skills by building on more basic information and procedures In other cases knowledge of one topic may affect learning a second topic even though the first isn t a necessary condition for the second Knowledge of French isn t essential for learning Spanish yet knowing French can help with Spanish because many words are similar in the two languages When knowledge of the first topic is helpful but not essential to learning the second one lateral transfer is occurring By the turn of the twentieth century the permanent repertoire of musical classics dominated almost every field of concert music from piano song or chamber music recitals to operas and orchestral concerts The change from a century before was enormous In the eighteenth century performers and listeners demanded new music all the time and ancient music included anything written more than twenty years earlier But musicians and audiences in the early s expected that most concert music they performed or heard would be at least a generation old and they judged new music by the standards of the classics already enshrined in the repertoire In essence concert halls and opera houses had become museums for displaying the musical artworks of the past two hundred years The repertoire varied according to the performing medium and from region to region but the core was largely the same throughout most of Europe and the Americas including operas and operatic excerpts from Mozart through Verdi Wagner and Bizet orchestral and chamber music from Haydn through the late Romantics and keyboard music by J S Bach Haydn Mozart Beethoven and prominent nineteenth century composers Living composers increasingly found themselves in competition with the music of the past This is the great theme of modern music in the classical tradition especially in the first half of the century in competing with past composers for the attention of performers and listeners who regarded the classical masterworks living composers sought to secure a place for themselves by offering something new and distinctive while continuing the tradition They combined individuality and innovation with emulation of the past seeking to write music that would be considered original and worthy of performance alongside the masterworks of earlier times Dear Mr Stevens This is the chief editor of Novel Flash Fiction As you were informed by our staff last week your short story will be published in the December issue of Novel Flash Fiction We thought hearing how you came up with your story would be meaningful to our readers We would thus like to ask if you could give a speech about your writing process This speech is expected to last for about an hour and it will take place at Star Bookstore downtown You can choose a specific date and time depending on your schedule If you have any questions please contact us by e mail at editors nff com We look forward to hearing how you wrote your story Sincerely Susanna Martinez Sure we ve all heard the advice Follow your passion It s great when you hit the jackpot and find a career that melds your strengths and passions and where there is demand in the highly competitive global marketplace of today But if your goal is to get a job at the end of the rainbow you must distinguish between your major your passions your strengths and your career path Your strengths are more important than your passions Studies show that the best career choices tend to be grounded in things you re good at more so than your interests and passions Ideally you want to find a convergence of your strengths and your values with a career path that is in demand Interests can come and go Your strengths are your core your hard wired assets Parents are quick to inform friends and relatives as soon as their infant holds her head up reaches for objects sits by herself and walks alone Parental enthusiasm for these motor accomplishments is not at all misplaced for they are indeed milestones of development With each additional skill babies gain control over their bodies and the environment in a new way Infants who are able to sit alone are granted an entirely different perspective on the world than are those who spend much of their day on their backs or stomachs Coordinated reaching opens up a whole new avenue for exploration of objects and when babies can move about their opportunities for independent exploration and manipulation are multiplied No longer are they restricted to their immediate locale and to objects that others place before them As new ways of controlling the environment are achieved motor development provides the infant with a growing sense of competence and mastery and it contributes in important ways to the infant s perceptual and cognitive understanding of the world It is a strategic and tactical mistake to give an offensive position away to those who will use it to attack criticize and blame Since opponents will undoubtedly attack criticize and blame anyway the advantages of being proactive airing one s own dirty laundry and telling on oneself are too significant to ignore Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around This approach is appropriately termed stealing thunder When an organization steals thunder it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties In experimental research by Arpan and Roskos Ewoldsen stealing thunder in a crisis situation as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings As significant the authors found that credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe If you ve ever seen the bank of flashing screens at a broker s desk you have a sense of the information overload they are up against When deciding whether to invest in a company for example they may take into account the people at the helm the current and potential size of its market net profits and its past present and future stock value among other pieces of information Weighing all of these factors can take up so much of your working memory that it becomes overwhelmed Think of having piles and piles of papers sticky notes and spreadsheets strewn about your desk and you get a picture of what s going on inside the brain When information overloads working memory this way it can make brokers and the rest of us scrap all the strategizing and analyses and go for emotional or gut decisions When considered in terms of evolutionary success many of the seemingly irrational choices that people make do not seem so foolish after all Most animals including our ancestors and modern day capuchin monkeys lived very close to the margin of survival Paleontologists who study early human civilizations have uncovered evidence that our ancestors faced frequent periods of drought and freezing When you are living on the verge of starvation a slight downturn in your food reserves makes a lot more difference than a slight upturn Anthropologists who study people still living in hunter gatherer societies have discovered that they regularly make choices designed to produce not the best opportunity for obtaining a hyperabundant supply of food but instead the least danger of ending up with an insufficient supply In other words people everywhere have a strong motivation to avoid falling below the level that will feed themselves and their families If our ancestors hadn t agonized over losses and instead had taken too many chances in going after the big gains they d have been more likely to lose out and never become anyone s ancestor According to many sociologists the study of what our society calls art can only really progress if we drop the highly specific and ideologically loaded terminology of art artworks and artists and replace these with the more neutral and less historically specific terms cultural forms cultural products and cultural producers These cultural products be they paintings sculptures forms of music or whatever should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts By using the more neutral term cultural products for particular objects and cultural producers for the people who make those objects the sociologist seeks to break with a view that she he sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category art This is a category that is too limited and context specific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as art and others as not the very term art itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur Quite simply then in order to study cultural matters many sociologists believe one has to reject the terms art artwork and artist as the basis for our analysis Instead these terms become important objects of analysis themselves Dear Ms Molly Oliver This is Mark Foster one of the volunteers for the Auditory Frog and Toad Survey Unfortunately I was not able to participate in the orientation last weekend so I could not receive training in distinguishing the sounds of frogs and toads I heard from another participant that a CD was used in the training session I was wondering if you could send me one Since we have ten more days before the survey begins I ll have enough time to receive and use the CD to train myself You can send it to me at the address in my application I am looking forward to hearing from you soon Thank you Sincerely Mark Foster Have you ever met someone while you were experiencing significant emotional psychological or physical stress Perhaps you stayed up all night studying for a final or maybe you learned that a grandparent recently died You likely exhibited behaviors that are not consistent with how you usually act Meeting someone when you are extremely stressed can create an inaccurate impression of you For this reason recognize that our first impressions of others also may be perceptual errors To help avoid committing these errors engage in perception checking which means that we consider a series of questions to confirm or challenge our perceptions of others and their behaviors For example see if you can provide two possible interpretations for the verbal and nonverbal behavior observed and seek clarification of it in order to determine the accuracy of your evaluation When we see a happy face or an angry one it subtly generates the corresponding emotion in us To the degree we take on the pace posture and facial expression of another person we start to inhabit their emotional space as our body mimics the other s we begin to experience emotional matching Our nervous system is automatically set to engage in this emotional empathy But how well we use this capacity is largely a learned ability Animals and people who have been raised in extreme social isolation are poor at reading emotional cues in those around them not because they lack the basic circuitry for empathy but because lacking emotional tutors they have never learned to pay attention to these messages and so haven t practiced this skill When we hear a story we look for beliefs that are being commented upon Any story has many possible beliefs inherent in it But how does someone listening to a story find those beliefs We find them by looking through the beliefs we already have We are not as concerned with what we are hearing as we are with finding what we already know that is relevant Picture it in this way As understanders we have a list of beliefs indexed by subject area When a new story appears we attempt to find a belief of ours that relates to it When we do we find a story attached to that belief and compare the story in our memory to the one we are processing Our understanding of the new story becomes at that point a function of the old story Once we find a belief and connected story we need no further processing that is the search for other beliefs stops Savannas pose a bit of a problem for ecologists There is an axiom in ecology that complete competitors cannot coexist in other words where two populations of organisms use exactly the same resources one would be expected to do so slightly more efficiently than the other and therefore come to dominate in the long term In temperate parts of the world either trees dominate in forests or grasses dominate in grasslands Yet in savannas grasses and trees coexist The classic explanation proposes that trees have deep roots while grasses have shallow roots The two plant types are therefore able to coexist because they are not in fact competitors the trees increase in wetter climates and on sandier soils because more water is able to penetrate to the deep roots Trees do indeed have a few small roots which penetrate to great depth but most of their roots are in the top half metre of the soil just where the grass roots are Lawyers and scientists use argument to mean a summary of evidence and principles leading to a conclusion however a scientific argument is different from a legal argument A prosecuting attorney constructs an argument to persuade the judge or a jury that the accused is guilty a defense attorney in the same trial constructs an argument to persuade the same judge or jury toward the opposite conclusion Neither prosecutor nor defender is obliged to consider anything that weakens their respective cases On the contrary scientists construct arguments because they want to test their own ideas and give an accurate explanation of some aspect of nature Scientists can include any evidence or hypothesis that supports their claim but they must observe one fundamental rule of professional science They must include all of the known evidence and all of the hypotheses previously proposed Unlike lawyers scientists must explicitly account for the possibility that they might be wrong The idea of protecting intellectual activity and creation has deep roots The ancient Greeks used an awards system to recognize design achievements which performed some of the same functions as the modern patent system Their pottery sculptures and other manufactured goods had symbols on them to note the tradesmen who created them which are the predecessors of modern trademarks Similar marks and symbols functioning as trademarks have been found on Chinese pottery possibly dating as far back as BCE and in many other ancient societies including the Egyptians the Assyrians and the Vedic civilization The concept of intellectual property continued to develop during the Roman period The Roman Empire had an incredible variety of trademarks Roman potters alone used approximately trademarks Additionally Roman authors had a sense that their intellectual creations were valuable as they complained about the exploitation of those creations Their sense of injustice was probably heightened by the fact that there were laws and traditions in place that supported their belief that only they could exploit their creations Roman authors could in fact make money from the copying and publishing of their works because the value of their intellectual creations was recognized Dear Mr Johnson I would like to thank you for approving my request that the company pay for my college tuition Today Human Resources informed me that you had signed my request for payment I want to tell you that this financial relief will make a great difference in my life Now I can focus more on my job This will enable me to perform better at my work and contribute more to the company Once again I appreciate your support of my tuition and your faith in me Sincerely Warwick Smith Planning involves only the half of your brain that controls your logical thinking The other intuitive half of your brain is left out of this planning process If you insist on always having a plan you cut yourself off from your intuitive self and the inner joy it provides To break planning addiction allow yourself one freedom Decide to spend a day exploring a park or a neighborhood with curiosity as your only guide The next time you feel attracted to someone and want to introduce yourself go ahead You ll be likely to make a new friend By giving yourself freedom to follow your intuition you develop your sensitivity to your inner voice You learn to hear the quiet messages that can make your life an adventure Although the Internet seems truly global these days less than half of the world s population has access to it Some four billion people are still unconnected This spring IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone Their goal is to establish a network of high altitude balloons that will rain G LTE signals down to anyone with a G device Regional telecom companies will transmit the signals to the balloons and then each balloon will relay the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter In this way farmers in remote areas will be able to access weather data and rural children will be able to pursue online educations By the end of the year the engineers aim to have balloons about miles up Inflation can be a major life concern for most people It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead This is because future problems concerning inflation often make us change our plans for the future For instance how much should the parents of a newborn start regularly saving to pay for her college education If inflation averages two percent prices roughly double every thirty six years But if inflation gets up to eight percent prices roughly double every nine years A Harvard education that currently costs may therefore end up costing half a million dollars for an infant born today Millions of workers who retired with pensions during the s and s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond their expected expenses Many had to reenter the workforce just to make ends meet Tourism is important for more than just vacationing Tourism allows people from different places and cultures to come together and then tourists and host communities learn about each other s differences and similarities They also learn new tastes and ways of thinking which may lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides for the survival of a society s culture especially the culture s art forms The opportunity to sell native artworks to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage local artists to preserve traditional art forms For example Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry crafts into profitable tourist businesses They also earn additional income by performing folk dances and fire walking There are two types of managers in business organizations functional managers and project managers Both types of managers have different roles and qualities Functional managers head one of a firm s departments such as marketing or engineering and they are specialists in the area they manage They are skilled at breaking the components of a system into smaller elements knowing something of the details of each operation for which they are responsible On the other hand project managers begin their career as specialists in some field When promoted to the position of project manager they must transform from technical caterpillar to generalist butterfly They oversee many functional areas each with its own specialists Therefore what is required is an ability to put many pieces of a task together to form a coherent whole Thus to understand a frog for example functional managers cut it open to examine it but project managers watch it swim with other frogs and consider the environment It isn t going to be easy making changes to the food your children eat and even the most careful patient parents will probably find that the little ones will resist at some point and to some degree The problem is that many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as children we learned the hard way And the temptation to continue with these parental habits with our own children is strong If you were made to sit at the table until you had cleaned your plate you are not alone most of the adult population have suffered this at some point at school if not at home Forcing your children to eat especially if they don t like what is on the plate is completely counterproductive Sit there until you finish may be how we learned and may also be the only way you feel able to achieve your goal but think about it the experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for joy the next time it is served This strict approach is very old fashioned and you may win the battle but you definitely won t win the war Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good idea too but guess what That doesn t work either No pudding until you have finished your main course was the standard line when most parents of today were young and is still commonly used but it only makes sweet things seem more desirable Dear Ms Mattie Thank you very much for offering me the research engineer position at ABC Company However after a great deal of thought I have decided not to accept the position Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me Unfortunately I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity Once again thank you for your consideration Very truly yours Christine Mahoe Obviously one of the judgments the public has of us is whether or not our telephone service is good Technically if they get their calls through efficiently and promptly they get what they want That however is not all they want They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration and they are in a position to get what they want They are in the driver s seat they are paying the bills and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations In order therefore for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner On the path to excellence some obstacles may initially seem overwhelming Every performer experiences this feeling even the greatest performers in the world If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities focusing on what is within your control taking the first step and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that If your commitment becomes weak remember your dream and why it is important to you find simple joys in your daily pursuits rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward and embrace the process of ongoing learning With a positive perspective and persistence you will get through and find a way through all obstacles For many years now mediated entertainment such as TV and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory senses with sights and sounds Some forms of new media however even engage our senses of touch and smell The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch New media may also include aromas such as Disney s Soaring Over California attraction at the California Adventure theme park where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang gliding experience across the countryside Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses Recently researchers have suggested that the purpose of laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful state but to actually induce this state in others as well According to this view the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits In this way laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities This would explain why laughter is so infectious when we hear someone laughing it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too An ant turns right left and moves ahead over a sandy hill How can we explain the complexity of the path it chose We can think up a sophisticated program in the ant s brain but it does not work What we have overlooked is the ant s environment The ant may be following a simple rule get out of the sun and back to the nest Complex behavior does not imply complex mental strategies The same holds for humans The apparent complexity of a man s behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself People adapt to their environments much as gelatin does if you wish to know what form it will have when it solidifies study the shape of the mold that holds the gelatin To understand behavior one has to look at both the mind and the environment When someone asks us How does that work or Why does that happen we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer After all it is efficient Another person asks a question we provide the answer to the question It is usually a win win The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence the loss of confidence Although the question wanted for an explanation what the asker received was a statement of fact Why does oil float on top of water in a glass Relative density What causes climate change Increased CO in the atmosphere Why does the ocean have tides The moon Giving direct accurate and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer But in reality it can shut the asker down A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step If the asker isn t familiar with relative density or CO he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a follow up question or probe for related ideas Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity Although direct answers are often needed and well placed they do not work universally A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of efficiency B In the nineteenth century a decisive moment occurred when people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they framed their stories and appeals with fear they could capture our attention It is an emotion we find hard to resist or control and so they constantly shifted our focus to new possible sources of anxiety the latest health scare the new crime wave and endless hazards in the environment of which we were not aware With the increasing sophistication of the media and the haunting quality of the imagery they have been able to give us the feeling that we are fragile creatures in an environment full of danger even though we live in a world infinitely safer and more predictable than anything our ancestors knew With their help our anxieties have only increased In the past many public sector recreation providers allowed people free access or charged for permits to control the amount or season for different recreational activities such as fishing or horse riding However governments and other public agencies are finding that funding to maintain sites and facilities to cope with increased demand on the landscape is becoming difficult to maintain Opportunities to charge visitors for appropriate services to help compensate for these costs are being considered as one solution This is a sensitive matter as free access for all people to the outdoors is a much cherished right There is also an additional dilemma for public agencies where recreation facilities are already provided from public money and it could be argued that the taxpayer is being charged twice Thus care is needed by public bodies to ensure that charges are only made for services that are clearly additional to the provision of free access A Dear Mayor Johnson I m a long time resident of Pinewood and I m really concerned about the traffic problem in my neighborhood The traffic has been increasing for the past three years and I ve seen many near accidents I feel the intersection at Burton Road and rd Street is very dangerous because there aren t any traffic lights The city should consider installing traffic lights as soon as possible I believe that this issue affects the safety of every driver or pedestrian who uses that intersection so it deserves immediate attention Nothing is as important as our citizens safety so fixing this issue should be made a top priority I would appreciate your sincere consideration Best regards Laura McPherson Everyone would like to assume that their wonderful creative ideas will sell themselves But as Galileo Edvard Munch Toni Morrison Sylvia Plath and millions of others have discovered they do not On the contrary creative ideas are usually viewed with suspicion and distrust Thus students need to learn how to persuade other people of the value of their ideas This selling is part of the practical aspect of creative thinking If students do a science project it is a good idea for them to present it and demonstrate why it makes an important contribution If they develop a plan for a new form of government they should explain why it is better than the existing form of government What do you think can make you a good tennis player Suppose there are two different tennis pros giving you tennis lessons The first pro says things like good shot and good swing all the time to encourage you The second one says good swing only when you make a good swing If just hearing good swing gives you a reward then you will prefer the first instructor But if what you want is to get better at tennis you will prefer the second instructor That s because the second instructor s feedback to you is much more informative than the first one s You re not after good swing rewards you re after a better tennis game So feedback that simply makes you feel great will not help you develop tennis skills in the long run In much of Europe many businesses close during the month of August when people go on vacation Most Europeans believe this is time that they should spend with family or engaging in personal activities The French in particular value their vacation time and prefer not to work overtime They enjoy the longest vacations of any country in the world French law states that employees must receive a minimum of five weeks of vacation a year German companies appear to be moving in this direction as well Despite the extended free time people of both France and Germany are very productive when they work To Europeans their vacation time seems valuable Because the Internet is free space where anybody can post anything it can be full of all sorts of useless data As a result organized knowledge could easily get corrupted or lost in a sea of junk data For books there are various filters that help readers distinguish between reliable and unreliable information On the Internet the relation between the producer and the consumer of information tends to be direct so nothing protects the consumer from polluted information There are of course advantages to the free exchange of information and I do believe any producers of data should have the freedom to make them available online However I am also convinced that users should be protected from corrupt knowledge by intermediary services There need to be some forms of guides and filters provided by responsible individuals and organizations Otherwise we may no longer be able to distinguish between the intellectual space of information and a polluted environment of meaningless data Thus reliable intermediary services will be needed in the future I have always been a huge fan of Redbug Cameras However when I purchased your newest model the Superimage I could not have been more disappointed I acquired it on June rd of this year and it does not function correctly The camera lens does not focus properly and the resulting photos are blurry and unclear I went to the local service center to get it repaired but the poor service I received there only complicated the problem I am extremely frustrated with the poor quality repairs that were made in addition to the overall inferior quality of the camera I insist on receiving a full refund Enclosed is a copy of the original receipt and the repair bill To require perfection is to invite paralysis The pattern is predictable as you see error in what you have done you steer your work toward what you imagine you can do perfectly You cling ever more tightly to what you already know you can do away from risk and exploration and possibly further from the work of your heart You find reasons to delay since to not work is to not make mistakes Believing that your work should be perfect you gradually become convinced that you cannot do it You are correct Sooner or later since you cannot do what you are trying to do you quit And in one of those little ironies of life only the pattern itself achieves perfection a perfect death spiral you misdirect your work you stall you quit A man standing on the street corner selling nonbreakable pens suddenly finds that the one he is demonstrating with breaks in half He stops for a moment turns to the crowd and declares Now I ll show you what the inside looks like Laughter can turn any disadvantage into an advantage People who know this not only look for some positive aspect in their misfortunes but actually go one step further After their initial shock they gather their resources overcome their problem and see opportunities where most of us fail to see them Moreover many who have experienced a major loss often go on to achieve remarkable feats in spite of their hardships because they focus on what they can gain from their circumstance rather than on what they have lost They believe in the old clich that every cloud has a silver lining and they actively seek the advantage in their disadvantage What everyday rules for behavior guide parents efforts to socialize their toddlers and preschool age children To answer this question Gralinski and Kopp observed and interviewed mothers and their children in these age groups They found that for fifteen month olds mothers rules and requests centered on ensuring the children s safety and to a lesser extent protecting the families possessions from harm respecting basic social niceties Don t bite No kicking and learning to delay getting what they wanted As children s ages and cognitive sophistication increased the numbers and kinds of prohibitions and requests expanded from the original focus on child protection and interpersonal issues to family routines self care and other concerns regarding the child s independence By the time children were three a new quality of rule emerged Do not scream in a restaurant run around naked in front of company or pick your nose Ancient Greek and Roman costume is essentially draped and presents a traditional stability and permanence While it received certain fashions over the centuries it never underwent any major transformation L on Heuzey the pioneer of the study of classical costume set forth with exemplary clarity its two basic principles the first is that Classical costume has no form in itself as it consisted of a simple rectangular piece of cloth woven in varying sizes according to its intended use and the height of the customer without differentiation between the sexes the second is that this cloth is always draped never shaped or cut and was worn round the body in accordance with definite rules Thus it was always fluid and live It is notable that we find no evidence in Classical times of tailors or dressmakers the word itself barely exists in Greek or Latin The streets of New York are home to numerous trucks vans stands and pushcarts all selling food Most of the vendors are immigrants bringing street versions of the world s diverse food traditions to this already international metropolis You can snack on Jamaican goat patties sample Chinese noodles take a bite of Egyptian falafel or enjoy vegetarian Sri Lankan curry New York even has an annual award ceremony the Vendy Awards for the best sidewalk chefs Part of the fun is tracking down the best offerings Trucks and vans often visit different areas of New York on different days some chefs operate only at certain times of day or only on weekends Even stands with regular spots and hours occasionally vanish as the owner finds a better spot or takes a week off Follow the crowds or ask locals for information hotel doormen will often let you into the secrets of a neighborhood s best vendors Fourteenth century approaches to music had a profound and continuing impact on music in later centuries Perhaps most significant was the invention of a precise and unambiguous notation that could record a wide variety of rhythms and allowed music to be distributed in writing and performed accurately wherever it went We now take this for granted when we play from notation and sight read through unfamiliar music but it was a remarkable innovation in the fourteenth century Among its effects was that composers could fix their music exactly as they wished it to be performed leading them to take pride in authorship The increased interest in the individual and in satisfying the human senses that was characteristic of the age grew stronger in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has remained important ever since All art is creation regardless of how closely the imitation approximates the original Even the most rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is ultimately selective Doing a portrait for example the artist may ask the subject to look serious not smile selecting a certain aspect of the person We know Mona Lisa Giaconda the subject of the most famous portrait in the world through her mysterious smile but we will never know what the entire person was like The treasure of art however is that its reality lives forever The final product is really an addition to reality not simply a way of totally reproducing it The artist always contributes something new something that never was put together in precisely that way before Leonardo s Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa The latter has long since gone to her reward the former will never die All his life Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a police officer But there was a major obstacle standing in his way He had leukemia and was not expected to make it to adulthood When he was seven years old Chris s disease got worse That s when a family friend Tommy Austin arranged for Chris to come as close as he could to living his dream He called Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day with some police officers When the day arrived Chris was welcomed by three squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer Frank Shankwitz Then he was treated to a ride in a police helicopter The officers finished the day by swearing Chris in as the first and only honorary state trooper The next day Cox presented Chris with an official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform With a smile that lit up the room he accepted it Two days later Chris died in the hospital his uniform close at hand Shankwitz was very sad but grateful that he had helped Chris He also realized that there were many other children like Chris That prompted Shankwitz to co found the Make A Wish Foundation It has now become the largest wish granting organization in the world enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand children This is an official notice from KGM the largest manufacturer of digital cameras in the world regarding the rules of KGM s Big World Competition First anyone over the age of is eligible with the exception of professional photographers Second all photographs must be taken using a KGM camera Third the size of your image file cannot exceed megabytes Finally entries must be uploaded to our website no later than July Failure to comply with any of the above rules will disqualify the entry A list of winners will be posted on the website on August and all winning pictures will be displayed at the KGM gallery for a period of one year A way to get things done more efficiently and get better results is to do the right thing at the right time of day Know your own body rhythm respect your internal clock and pay attention to how your energy level ebbs and flows during the day If you have lots of energy early in the morning that is when you should schedule difficult activities whether for you these are brainstorming writing or practicing Use the same principle in planning activities for your team Schedule intervals of productive time and breaks so that you get the most from people I always ask people to respect their own body rhythms when scheduling appointments In my experience most people are far more productive in the morning but there are those who differ and hit their stride later in the day While in Japan I ordered green tea with sugar at a restaurant A waiter politely explained that one does not drink green tea with sugar I responded that I was aware of this custom but I liked my tea sweet The waiter took up the issue with the manager After a lengthy conversation the manager came over and said I m very sorry We don t have sugar Disappointed I changed my order to a cup of coffee which the waiter soon brought over Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar My failure to obtain a cup of sweet green tea was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice In America a paying customer has every right to have a request met But from a Japanese perspective it is their duty to protect those who do not know any better After a stressful day how do you wind down and clear your mind Relaxing in a comfortable chair putting on some soothing sounds and reading something light and entertaining are all good methods to get ready for some restful sleep But as you ease your exhausted senses do not forget your sense of smell Certain aromas can fill you with feelings of tranquility and research has found that lavender vanilla and green apple are among the best smells to help lower anxiety and induce sleep You can use essential oils of these scents by applying them to the back of your neck or the inside of your wrist Even better indulge in a warm bath with these oils dissolved in the water Before bed you might enjoy a glass of hot soy milk with natural vanilla flavoring for a calming effect inside and out Here is a surprise for you Being happy means that you realize that there are times that you will be unhappy and recognize that life sometimes stinks What is uplifting in those times is appreciating life and facing the challenges that come with it realizing that you are facing challenges fellow humans have also faced We are not saying you should lower your expectations for your so called perfect life or downsize your goals we just believe that if you can align your expectations with reality a little more by expecting to face challenges you will be better off in the end There is an interesting biological reinforcement for this notion too Your levels of C reactive protein a marker of damaging inflammation have been shown to be higher when you have expectations that are unattainable The Greek philosopher Socrates observed The unexamined life is not worth living For most people however reflection and self examination do not come naturally As much as any other kind of thinking reflection requires solitude Distraction and reflection simply do not mix It is not the kind of thing you can do well near a television while the phone is ringing or with children in the same room One of the reasons I have been able to accomplish much and keep growing personally is that I have not only set aside time to reflect but I have separated myself from distractions for short blocks of time thirty minutes in the spa an hour outside on a rock in my backyard or a few hours in a comfortable chair in my office The place does not matter as long as you remove yourself from distractions and interruptions Virtuoso violinist Pinchas Zukerman was giving a master class to a group of young artists who had come to the Aspen Music Festival from all over the world The auditorium was filled with aspiring artists distinguished teachers and well known performers the atmosphere was competitive and electric As each performer played Zukerman offered friendly advice and encouragement invariably picking up his own violin to demonstrate finer points of technique The last musician performed brilliantly When the applause subsided Zukerman complimented the artist then picked up his own violin tucked it under his chin paused a long moment and then without playing a note or uttering a word he placed the instrument back in its case The audience responded with deafening applause in recognition of this master musician who could pay so gracious a compliment Whenever you stand on a scale in your bathroom or place a melon on a scale at the grocery store you are measuring weight An object s weight is the force exerted on it by gravity usually the earth s gravity When you stand on a bathroom scale the scale measures just how much upward force it must exert on you in order to keep you from moving downward toward the earth s center As in most scales you will encounter the bathroom scale uses a spring to provide this upward support If you are stationary you are not accelerating so your downward weight and the upward force from the spring must cancel one another that is they must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction so that they sum to zero net force Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors comes from studies of the following type Soak your tongue for seconds in a sour solution such as unsweetened lemon juice Then try tasting some other sour solution such as dilute vinegar You will find that the second solution tastes less sour than usual Depending on the concentrations of the lemon juice and vinegar the second solution may not taste sour at all This phenomenon called adaptation reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes Now try tasting something salty sweet or bitter These substances taste about the same as usual In short you experience little cross adaptation reduced response to one taste after exposure to another Evidently the sour receptors are different from the other taste receptors Similarly you can show that salt receptors are different from the others and so forth My sister Tara was the quiet one in the family She was not as adventurous as my brother and I She never excelled at school or sports Of course I loved my sister but at times that was not so easy to do She seldom made eye contact with me When we ran into each other at school she sometimes pretended not to recognize me One day my father s job forced us to move to a new neighborhood The nurse at our new school Emerson gave us ear and eye exams our first ever I aced the tests Eagle eyes and elephant ears the nurse said but Tara struggled to read the eye chart She declared Tara severely shortsighted and she had to get glasses When the glasses were ready we all went downtown to pick them up The first time she tried them on she kept moving her head around and up and down What s the matter I asked You can see that tree over there she said pointing at a sycamore tree about a hundred feet away I nodded She sobbed I can see not just the branches but each little leaf Tara burst into tears On the way home she kept seeing for the first time all these things that most everyone else had stopped noticing She read street signs and billboards aloud She pointed out sparrows sitting on the telephone wires At home Tara insisted that I try on her glasses I put them on and the world turned into fuzzy unfocused shapes I took a few steps and banged my knee on the coffee table It was at that very moment that I truly understood Tara for the first time I realized why she did not like to go exploring or why she did not recognize me at school Tara loved seeing the world clearly Not long after she got her glasses she decided she wanted to be an artist She started compulsively drawing and painting all the wondrous things she was discovering Her first painting of the sycamore tree is still her favorite Today she is an art teacher at Emerson where she tries to bring the best out of each individual student I have seen people who are very good at their jobs but are poor at presenting themselves and hence do not convince the audience of their capabilities Presentation is so crucially important and will make the difference between getting a sale or not Some people are naturally good presenters but brushing up on your skills in this area will prove profitable There are lots of courses available that are good Try Think Business where courses are cheap or even free The ABC Marketing Institute also offers very good presentation skills courses A good course will help you structure your presentations and improve your own personal style I would recommend one that films you while you are presenting and then gives a critique of your style Every writer is starting from a different point and is bound for a different destination Yet many writers are paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with everybody else who is trying to write and presumably doing it better This can often happen in a writing class Inexperienced students are chilled to find themselves in the same class with students whose articles have appeared in the college newspaper But writing for the college paper is no great credit I have often found that the hares who write for the paper are overtaken by the tortoises who move studiously toward the goal of mastering the craft The same fear hangs around freelance writers who see the work of other writers appearing in magazines while their own keeps returning in the mail Forget the competition and go at your own pace One of the most potentially productive trends in education today is the focus on interdisciplinary studies teaching math as it applies to science for example or relating the various humanities This applies to art education too If we trivialize art and remove it from the core of a mainstream education we not only deny our students full access to one of humankind s most profound experiences but we miss countless opportunities to improve their grasp of other subjects as well Moreover we deny students access to an extremely useful kind of training and a productive mode of thought We should also consider that the more legitimately we weave art into the fabric of the general curriculum the better our students will understand the important role art plays in culture Our love for another person pulls us out of ourselves and lifts our thoughts to a grander scale How can I make the world better for this person When I was young the only love I experienced was the immature selfish love of I love her because she makes me feel good Now I think about the woman I love in terms of what she wants I want to make her happy because I cannot be happy when she is unhappy We discover that the act of giving true love is more powerful than getting the hug you need if we can get over our own hunger for love then we have reached the state of pure love of being connected to a larger ideal bigger than our own individual life Science of course is an indispensable source of information for the contemporary writer It is furthermore a necessary part of his highly technological environment Thus it is also an inevitable component of his sensibility and a decisive even if often unrecognized component of his creative imagination But science is not in itself an elemental well spring of literature Even the most refined and precise research data are only raw materials which may or may not become literature For whatever becomes a work of art of any kind does so as a result of an act of creation an act of artistic composition an act involving the art of make believe Scientific statements or remarks as such even when they are valid reliable and comprehensive are not literature One of the common mistakes that employers make is looking at a team of employees as a homogeneous group that rises and falls together Offering incentives such as a group bonus or a vacation trip to a team as a whole is not a smart managerial move because it fails to acknowledge who an individual is For example sending an entire team to Hawaii for a job well done actually discourages an employee s efforts to do his best work He only needs to perform well enough to help achieve the team objective If on the other hand the employee knew that individual rewards were possible he would be more likely to strive to outperform expectations While teamwork is important within a corporation management should come up with new compensation packages to help individuals to become champions Many theatergoers have been offered lots of good plays including West Side Story The King and I and Dracula for several decades However they have hardly ever seen new works recently because many producers have avoided making a new play Part of the reason may be the tremendous cost of making a new production these days It is true that many producers asked to invest a few hundred thousand dollars in a production have preferred a play of proven merit and past success to a new untried play That sounds like a reasonable excuse but in fact this practice can lead to an undesirable situation Unless new plays are given a chance today there will be nothing to revive in the future If you compare a walnut with some of the beautiful and exciting things that grow on our planet it does not seem to be a marvelous creation It is common rough not particularly attractive and certainly not of much value Besides it is small Its growth is limited by the hard shell that surrounds it the shell from which it never escapes during its lifetime Of course that is the wrong way to judge a walnut Break one open and look inside See how the walnut has grown to fill every corner available to it It had no say in the size or shape of that shell However given those limitations it achieved its full growth How lucky we will be if like the walnut we blossom and bloom in every aspect of the life that is given us Take heart If one nut can do it so can you If someone were to say Life is a cup of coffee it is unlikely that you would have heard this expression before But its novelty forces you to think about its meaning The vehicle used a cup of coffee is a common object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as a source for thinking about that life The metaphor compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the kinds of physical social and other attributes that are associated with a cup of coffee For this metaphor to gain currency however it must capture the fancy of many other people for a period of time Then and only then will its novelty have become worn out and will it become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor life is a drinking substance After that expressions such as life is a cup of tea life is a bottle of beer life is a glass of milk will become similarly understandable as offering different perspectives on life Sometimes someone saying you can t do something is good for you It builds mental toughness and conviction I often tell people Anyone with young children will tell you if you ask them not to do something they re guaranteed to do it The following story is an example of how my dad used this to his and ultimately my advantage As a child I wasn t particularly academic or ambitious and certainly didn t work very hard at my studies It wasn t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh grade and facing the prospect of leaving school without any sense of what I wanted to do as a career that I decided to apply to the local college to pursue further study Feeling pleased with myself for having made this monumental decision I proudly announced my plan to my dad His immediate reaction was to say You ll never do that They ll never accept you I was so annoyed and upset by his response that I worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year In those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended up winning three awards at the end of year prize giving The best part was being able to tell my dad that I d been awarded a place at college On hearing this news he simply lowered his newspaper and with a smile said Well done I always knew you would At that moment I realized what he had done by discouraging me This was my first experience of reverse psychology Some people might say it s a risky strategy but it has certainly worked for me It has been extremely valuable in my life giving me the confidence determination and motivation to succeed even when the odds are stacked against me Now as a father myself I sometimes use the same technique to motivate my own son Often enough he ends up with favorable results I just hope one day he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind Sometimes all a good cheese needs to stop it from going bad is a sympathetic ear Researchers in France have come up with an ultrasonic sensor that will listen to cheese as it matures and warn cheese makers of defects Cheese makers have to downgrade up to one fifth of their produce because of undetected faults If the new device works well that problem could be reduced The technique involves sending a low frequency ultrasonic signal through the cheese to a sensor at the other side By measuring the change in the speed and size of the emerging signal the moisture and porosity of the cheese can be mapped Nobody likes performance reviews Employees are nervous they will hear nothing but criticism and bosses are nervous their direct reports will respond defensively So people generally keep their mouths shut That is unfortunate because most employees need help figuring out how to improve their performance and advance their careers Also it can be harmful to the company if a lack of clear feedback leads to undesirable work behaviors There is a way to avoid this problem Managers can help employees learn adaptive techniques like acknowledging negative emotions and reframing fears and criticisms constructively to prevent destructive responses Once people are comfortable asking for feedback they will begin to see how they are doing relative to management s priorities and their work will be more in line with organizational goals Composers describe their private world through the use of sound Making such a description concrete and detailed requires not just inspiration but certain practical tools and skills No matter what style of music you write you need to understand dynamics and speed the uses of harmony and rhythm You also need to know the range and capabilities of instruments the possibilities of the human voice and the problems of acoustics You need to be able to devise a blueprint that communicates to your musicians what it is you want to hear A young composer who takes a shortcut in this technical training in his rush to play the role of a composer will dry up very fast If you learn the proper techniques then the passion if it is genuine will come through Clients send a steady stream of clues and messages through their facial expression body movement and voice pitch Counselors need to learn how to read these messages without distorting or overinterpreting them in order to establish and maintain relationships with their clients For instance when Denise says to Jennie It seems that it s hard for you to talk about yourself Jennie says No I don t mind at all But the real answer is probably in her nonverbal behavior for she speaks hesitatingly while looking away and frowning Reading such clues helps Denise understand Jennie better Our nonverbal behavior has a way of leaking messages about what we really mean The unplanned nature of nonverbal behavior contributes to this leakage even in the case of highly defensive clients Sweeping statements have been made about the effect of clothing on the behavior of a child It has been said that a child who is better dressed is better behaved and that a child who is dressed like a cowboy is louder than he is when dressed in ordinary clothes Clothing however might have a temporary effect on the behavior of the child but not a lasting effect That is we would predict that a child who was dressed in his best clothes and whose mother stressed that they were best would be better behaved for a short period but by the end of the hour the child would have forgotten his clothes and would be acting as he would in old clothes Likewise the child who is dressed in a cowboy outfit might be very noisy while playing cowboys for a brief time but he might soon change to another activity and be no more noisy than usual A study found that enrollment in physical education classes was not related to academic achievement scores but involvement in vigorous physical activity was Students who engaged in vigorous activity outside of school at least minutes per day three days per week were found to have higher academic scores Students in the physical education class spent an average of only minutes out of a minute class engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity Given that this amount and intensity of activity in physical education classes had no correlation to students academic achievement whereas there was a significant association between academic achievement and vigorous activity outside of school the researchers propose that there may be a certain minimum level of activity necessary to produce the potentially desirable effects The tragic heroes in Shakespeare s plays have free will They possess their own defects of character that bring their downfalls Macbeth is ambitious but weak Othello is jealous Hamlet cannot make up his mind but all three might have made themselves into better human beings Nothing outside themselves prevents them from taking the right path as opposed to the wrong or tragic path On the other hand for the heroes in Greek tragedies where fate embodied in the oracles prevails there is no free will The gods control a man s destiny and one cannot fight the gods Regardless of their strength or wisdom the heroes cannot control their own future That is why the heroes in Greek tragedies can be compared to fish in the net The descriptions of sound production have been rewritten in this edition so as to update the theory on which they were based and to provide better practical advice regarding pronunciation problems Several figures have been redrawn in order to achieve greater accuracy and clearer detail The authors have tried to eliminate traces of gender biased attitudes wherever they were detected and a definite attempt has been made to balance female and male references The most significant kind of change in the new edition however is the result of the effort we have made to introduce more use of language for real communicative purposes in the learning activities suggested for students to carry out The introduction of the player piano in the United States at the turn of the th century had been accompanied by fairly critical comments Player pianos produced music mechanically through a set of instructions stored on a music roll Although proponents of the player piano such as piano manufacturers and publishers of sheet music thought that it would lead to an almost universal music education many music teachers musicians and composers opposed it Opponents claimed that one could copy sound but not interpretation and that mechanical instruments reduced the expression of music to mathematical systems For this reason they believed that mechanized music lessened the ideal of beauty by producing the same after same with no soul no joy no passion and that the introduction of the player piano would lead to the disappearance of amateur players It was spring and some th grade boys at a suburban elementary school were fooling around on the playground They had discovered a great new trick One of them would kneel down behind someone and the other would push the person over The trick worked perfectly with Anna She fell over with ease She was hurt and crying In the process she had broken her wrist The yard duty staff sent the shaken boys to the principal The principal began by saying that she understood that they were playing and had not meant to cause serious harm but that in fact they had She explained that the girl would have to wear a cast for weeks and now lots of ordinary things would be more difficult for her She pointed out that the girl played the flute and would now not be able to play in the spring concert By the time she finished the boys were in tears and very sorry for what they had done The principal also suspended the boys for a day explaining to them that even though she knew they were sorry and had not meant to cause such harm she believed suspension was necessary to signal to everyone in the community the seriousness of the situation On their own the boys brought the girl flowers and apologized for hurting her Welcome and thank you for joining the dining club Our club offers a unique dining experience You will be trying food from all over the world but more importantly you will have the chance to experience each country s dining traditions and customs In India for example they use their hands to eat If you are used to using forks and knives you may find this challenging In France dinners have many courses so make sure to schedule enough time for the French meal In Japan they don t eat their soup with a spoon so you have to drink directly from the bowl These are some of the things you will experience every Saturday evening until the end of August We hope you will enjoy your dining adventure It is around the age of ten or eleven that most children take on music as a real interest By the age of eighteen or twenty most people form their tastes for music We seek out different kinds of music and the choice of music has important social consequences We listen to the music that our friends listen to In search of our identity we form bonds or social groups with people whom we want to be like As a way of externalizing the bond we listen to the same kind of music and music becomes a mark of personal and group identity and of distinction In recent years knitting has become increasingly popular with the younger generation Why are so many young people taking up knitting as a hobby Knitting is skill oriented with the chance for them to take on increasingly harder challenges and to get intense satisfaction from accomplishing them And in today s world where teenagers are looking for unique ways to express themselves handmade clothes and accessories can be a smart creative way for them to express their individual personalities Despite what most people believe many of today s kids have longer attention spans than we think and they are passionate about creating not just personal websites but also attractive useful knit products that mark their presence in the world Sometimes you work as hard as you can on something and it doesn t work out I usually persist longer than most people would in a similar situation which is why I often succeed where others have failed I also know that sometimes you have to throw in the towel I remember one project I spent weeks working on at my architecture firm I spent many late nights trying to perfect my design but it just wasn t coming together I finally realized that I had to start over from scratch Maybe you have failed in similar situations but you probably learned something valuable Add it up to experience don t take it personally and go find your next challenge The high level of euro skepticism in Greece has brought a number of misunderstandings It is commonly thought that the launch of the euro Europe s single currency brought about an increase in the cost of living and this has affected the public s overall opinion toward the European Union The rise in prices is unquestionable but it is wrong to blame it on the introduction of the common currency This is firstly because inflation existed before the euro and secondly because one cannot say where prices would stand today if the drachma was still in circulation Therefore high prices must be attributed to market distortions The real problem is not the euro currency but the profiteers who are left unchecked Most people believe that intelligence plays the key role in children s academic achievement A recent study however found that the ability to self regulate to pay attention to a task and control impulsive behavior was more important than intelligence for early academic success Clancy Blair who led the study said that children need to be provided with self regulating activities to decrease impulsiveness and instant satisfaction and to promote attention and awareness of their own and other s thoughts and feelings Parents are advised to engage their children in activities that involve taking turns paying attention for sustained periods and giving incentives for thoughtful responses We offer lengthy scientific explanations as answers to children s questions when a direct experience of something similar or an image that can live and work in their imagination would be much more satisfying to them Rational explanations are like giving a hungry child stones instead of bread A well known early childhood educator points out that when young children ask questions like Why does the sun shine they are really asking about purpose rather than mechanics They are much more nourished by an answer like To keep us warm and to make the grass and the flowers grow than a lecture on the relationship between heat and other forms of energy The air just above a glass contains molecules that are layered like a cake At the top are the lightest scents of flowers then the fruity ones then the mineral and earthy smells and finally at the bottom the heaviest scent elements wood and alcohol A good glass does not allow these elements to be mixed up in a disorderly way Golf ball size cups are just too small to concentrate the wine s scents They are like seats too close to the orchestra all you hear are isolated sounds from the instruments rather than the harmony that comes together farther back The glass doesn t change the wine itself but rather the way we smell and taste it Some glasses are like loudspeakers their shape and volume increase a wine s natural qualities Charles Wilson was asked how his experience as president of a large company could apply to the presidents of small companies Wilson answered that when he was just a boy he worked for a dairy filling milk bottles The bottles were all different sizes Working in the dairy he learned that no matter what size the bottle was the cream the best part of milk always came to the top You can learn the same lesson It doesn t matter what size company you work for you can always be the cream To become the cream continue to learn throughout your life be open to new ideas and be aware of what is going on in the world which will affect you You will rise to the top The gym teacher walked into the room and recognized that I had been fighting with Matt He sent us out to the running track He followed us with a smile on his face and said I want both of you to run the track holding each other s hands The class captain erupted into a roar of laughter and we were embarrassed beyond belief Hesitantly my enemy and I started running What had earlier been fists were now linked in a strange handshake At some point during the course of the obligatory mini marathon that both of us felt anger about I remember looking over at the large person beside me His nose was still bleeding a bit Tears filled his eyes His giant body slowed him down Suddenly it struck me that here was a person not all that different from myself I guess my unwilling partner thought the same thing because we both looked at each other and began to laugh In time we became good friends I no longer saw the big figure in the same light Instead of the dull boy who I had hated for a long time here was someone like me the human being who had internal value and worth far beyond any externals It was amazing what I had learned from being forced to run hand in hand with someone For the rest of my life I have never raised a hand against another person Sometimes promises made in good faith can t be kept Even though we strive to be error free it s inevitable that problems will occur Not everything that affects your customer s experience with you is within your control What should you do when the service promise is broken When you discover a broken promise or have one pointed out to you the first thing to do is to apologize Don t waste time blaming yourself your company or your customer Admit that something has gone wrong and immediately find out what your customer s needs are In the United States some people maintain that TV media will create a distorted picture of a trial while leading some judges to pass harsher sentences than they otherwise might However there are some benefits connected to the televising of trials It will serve to educate the public about the court process It will also provide full and accurate coverage of exactly what happens in any given case Therefore it is necessary to televise trials to increase the chance of a fair trial And if trials are televised a huge audience will be made aware of the case and crucial witnesses who would otherwise have been ignorant of the case may play their potential role in it In World War II some musicians offered to play for the entertainment of wounded soldiers They were surprised to see that their performances achieved more than they had expected at first a diversion from the boredom and routine of hospital life Their performances resulted in a lessening of depression greater socialization among the patients and increased emotional expression Since then music has come to be recognized as a practical and productive way to improve physical emotional and mental conditions Man has built his world he has built factories and houses he produces cars and clothes he grows grain and fruit and so on But he is not really the master any more of the world he has built on the contrary this man made world has become his master before whom he bows down and whom he tries to please as best he can The work of his own hands has become his master He seems to be driven by self interest but in reality he has become an instrument for the purposes of the very machine his hands have built One of the most important aspects of human communication is that past experiences will affect your behavior Even when you start to discuss some event with your friends you may soon discover there are differences in your perceptions What you think boring your friends may find exciting what you consider pointless they may find meaningful The messages you receive may be the same for each of you Yet each person experiences a variety of feelings and sensations because each has a unique personality and background Each of you brings different backgrounds to the event and as a result each attributes different meanings to the shared experience The family is an easy target for those who regard bad people doing bad things as the basic cause of social problems They assume that when the family fails the rest of society fails This view of the world is defective in two fundamental respects First it does not consider the fact that families reflect social conditions Second it ignores the structural reasons for family breakdown and the profound changes occurring throughout the world Even in very different societies families are going through similar changes as a result of global economic changes This phenomenon shows the fact that families cannot avoid social influences on their everyday lives The zoologist and specialist in human behavior Desmond Morris says that the reason people start to walk like each other is that they have a subconscious need to show their companions that they agree with them and so fit in with them This is also a signal to other people that we are together we are acting as one Other studies suggest that we adopt the mannerisms of our company as well especially our superiors such as crossing our legs in the same direction as others An example often given is when in a meeting the boss scratches his nose and others at the table then follow him without realizing it It is evident that humans tend to exploit natural resources to benefit themselves It is equally evident that the use of natural resources without restoring them will eventually lead to their destruction There are two extreme positions on the issue Some people maintain that human dominance in nature is a natural process and as the dominant species humans have the right to exploit all other species Other people recognize humans as the only one among the living organisms that can change its behavior to preserve other species They believe that humans have the moral obligation to protect all other forms of life While we re walking or traveling we normally spend less than a second looking at everyday objects that we encounter The days pass by us without our really being aware of them Scientists have discovered that the average time we spend looking at things has been steadily decreasing during the last years In their study they also discovered that this decrease leads to a lack of interest and enjoyment in life Just try looking at objects for at least five seconds Good opportunities for this exercise come when you re walking or looking out of a car or train window You ll find that five seconds is long enough to help you appreciate things from a new point of view A short time ago some builders working on a studio in Connecticut left a huge square of plate glass standing upright in a field A sparrow flying swiftly across the field struck the glass and was knocked out He woke and went to his club where an attendant bandaged his head What happened asked a seagull I was flying across a meadow when all of a sudden the air crystallized on me said the sparrow The seagull a hawk and an eagle all laughed heartily A crow listened gravely For fifteen years I ve flown this country said the eagle and I assure you there is no such thing as air crystallizing Water yes air no You were probably struck by a hailstone the hawk told the sparrow Or he may have had a stroke said the seagull What do you think crow Why I think maybe the air crystallized on him said the crow The large birds laughed so loudly that the sparrow became annoyed And then the sparrow bet each of them ten worms that they couldn t follow the course he had flown without encountering the hardened atmosphere They all took his bet the crow went along to watch Later the seagull the eagle and the hawk decided to fly together over the route the sparrow indicated You come too they said to the crow I I well no said the crow I don t think I will So the three large birds took off together And they hit the glass together and were all knocked out We appreciate your giving us the opportunity to inspect your copier Our service representatives found two problems contributing to the copier s breakdown Firstly it is apparently being used for a slightly higher volume of copying than it was built for Secondly there are indications that a number of people in your department are not properly closing the cover before copying documents These two factors have caused the failure of many mechanical parts Although we are not prepared to offer you a replacement copier as you requested we would be happy to take the damaged one as a trade in on another larger capacity copier The Douglas Academy has continued to develop After three years of continuing academic achievements we successfully introduced Chinese Spanish and French into the curriculum along with other new courses to keep the academy vital and to meet better the students needs in this age of globalization We also recruited outside supporters who gave financial and other types of aid to help us carry out these new programs We want students to spend most of their time in the academy since many students do not have quiet places to study ready access to tutors or recreation areas in which to play sports or to take part in other activities Imagine how nice it would be if you had a whole extra hour in the morning to do some things you ve been waiting to do like taking a walk Adding an extra hour to the day especially if you use it to do something other than work is an effective way to relieve stress and to give yourself the feeling of having much more time and energy throughout the day This may mean going to bed an hour earlier but having an extra hour in the morning is so much more productive than staying up an hour later at the end of the day A man who had been a poor shepherd in his early years became a very wealthy respected diplomat and he was appointed as an ambassador to a country in Africa In his residence near the embassy he had one room known as the shepherd s room In that room were reproductions of hills valleys running streams rocks barns and fences for the sheep Here were the sticks he had carried and the clothes he had worn as a shepherd when looking after the sheep When asked one day the reason for this he replied If ever my heart is tempted to arrogance and pride I go into that room and remind myself of what I once was This morning I had a longing for some orange juice I knew there must be some in the refrigerator since my roommate went shopping yesterday I took an orange labeled can out of the refrigerator and made myself a glass When I tasted it it was strange I spat it out in the sink since I was sure that it was spoiled I decided that I might as well take it back to the grocer s and get our money back I fished the can out of the garbage and looked at the label To my surprise it said Tangerine Juice I couldn t believe it I tasted some of the juice left in the glass and it was good tangerine juice Goya painted some of his finest portraits around the time when he married in Because of his deafness the artist was largely reliant on the gestures of those he was communicating with he could make himself understood in sign language with only a few of his closest friends and relatives This undoubtedly contributed to his sensitivity as a portrait painter Spanish portrait painting had long been characterized by a high degree of naturalism Goya however combined a sharp sighted perception with his freer open technique of painting This provided his portraits with an unusual degree of animation as though a smile had briefly flashed across a sitter s face a moment before or the sitter had just moved A wise man will cultivate a servant s spirit for that particular attribute attracts people like no other As I humbly serve others their wisdom is freely shared with me Often the person who develops a servant s spirit becomes wealthy beyond measure Many times a servant has the ear of the king and a humble servant often becomes a king for he is the popular choice of the people He who serves the most grows the fastest I will become a humble servant I will not look for someone to open the door for me I will look to open the door for someone I will not be distressed when no one is available to help me I will be excited when I am available to help someone It has been said that a weed is any plant growing in the wrong place Yet with a small shift in perspective we can change this definition to a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered Many weeds are edible and medicinal They also increase biodiversity provide valuable information about the condition of our land or can bring up valuable nutrients from the subsoil to the surface where they eventually become available to other plants Those plants that we call weeds are often beneficial A group of researchers measured the performance of amateur cyclists who engaged in second sprint sessions three times a week for two weeks The results were astonishing By the end of the trial riders who once barely lasted minutes at top speed could cycle at full speed for almost an hour What changed Experts don t know for certain but most think the gains had something to do with some muscle fibers These lie inactive until you re running to save your baby from a speeding car said one of the researchers He added Short intensive training should be uncomfortable In just a few weeks however your fitness level will go through the roof Starting August st you will closely follow the activities of the International Monetary Fund IMF You will help and advise in the preparation of international meetings You will also write analytical papers about issuesregardinginternationalfinancialmarkets We expect you to have completed your university studies with a doctoral degree in economics Experience in analytical economic methods and the ability to work efficiently will also be required This is an interesting opportunity to work with a competent and experienced team Certain discoveries in genetics in brain surgery and in many other areas can be misused causing great damage to humanity This is unavoidable as long as industrial and military organizations are free to make use of new theoretical discoveries These organizations must not be allowed to determine the application of scientific research This will require a control board whose permission would be necessary for the practical application of any new theoretical discovery Needless to say such a control board must be legally and psychologically independent of industry the government and the military Employers may not accept the idea of telecommuting They may feel a loss of control over employees who work at home Besides employers often believe that the best work gets done when people work with other people Face to face meetings are not possible with telecommuters Meetings on the phone are not the same The subtle message of body language gets lost in phone conversations It is also not possible to solve problems that need immediate attention The biggest problem in fact may be trust Can an employer trust the employee to do his or her work without a manager watching Since a basic vocabulary of words the core vocabulary plays such an important role in English some people have suggested that acquiring it will allow you to understand or percent of everything that you hear or read in English In fact things are more complicated than that What actually happens is that with a vocabulary of words you can understand everything you see or hear a lot of the time but other times you won t understand anything at all It depends on what kind of situation you are dealing with The core vocabulary will allow you to deal with a large number of ordinary everyday situations but once you leave these predictable situations you will find it hard to get by with only a restricted vocabulary Much of the culture of Alaska s Natives disappeared with the great plagues prior to the s The educational system also discouraged Native arts and culture In recent decades however there has been a significant revival of interest in Native culture Now there exist new training programs for the declining Native languages Even with the many cultural and economic obstacles very significant elements of Native life remain and are getting stronger in Alaska We have all experienced events that might be considered extraordinary Perhaps you were cleaning out a closet and found a gift from someone you hadn t spoken with in years then an hour later unexpectedly that person rings you on the phone Can such moments be attributed to mere coincidence Of course they can but on closer examination they can also prove to be glimpses of the miraculous Each time we have an experience like this we can choose to think nothing of it or we can recognize it for the potentially life changing event it may prove to be I have been fascinated by the role that coincidence plays in guiding and shaping our lives It is natural that people will always want to have holidays And holiday areas will always want to have tourists around Consequently this has resulted in a rapid rise in tourism over the last thirty years More and more people are taking holidays Most people are now better off than in the past and have more money available for holidays People also have more leisure time and the length of their annual holidays has increased In addition places have become more accessible as transportation improvements have made travel faster easier and cheaper The great innovation in the development of costume in Europe after the mid fourteenth century was the abandonment of the long flowing costume common to both sexes Costume then became short for men and long for women and buttoned or laced This development led to the disappearance from everyday wear of an ancient form inherited over several thousand years It also represented a first step towards modern costume Around this change began to spread throughout Europe Sometimes parents are surprised to realize that teenagers don t seem to understand the connection between hard work and success Certainly the images of success as depicted in the media rarely show the years of struggle and practice that musicians actors or athletes engage in before their instant successes Impressionable teens may well see the final product and imagine that success really can happen overnight Often they don t know the long story of struggle and persistence behind the success Thank you for taking time to discuss with me both my career goals and the needs of your organization I appreciate your offering me a position as a receptionist Unfortunately I must decline your offer at this time As I mentioned when we met I am eager to put my newly acquired travel agent skills to work and would like to begin as an assistant travel agent I am nevertheless sad that we will not be working together I hope you will understand my decision Distance learning has recently become prominent in the field of further education However much about the processes and the participants involved is yet to be fully understood Although new technologies give educational institutions access to new students they provide little meaningful information about those students Despite the fact that the prime focus has been placed on the role of technology in distance learning experienced educators insist that technology in itself is not as important as other factors Instead they identify learner motivation teacher responsiveness and the accessibility of study materials as being of greater importance in the distance learning context With all of the recent changes it is surprising that newspapers are doing as well as they are Though more people are watching television and reading magazines local papers are still in business They work hard to meet local interests and needs reporting local news and sports and showing pictures that are of local interest Local papers also include something that newspapers still do best advertising Newspaper advertising has increased in the last few decades especially local advertising and classified or private and personal advertising Many people read local newspapers especially for the advertisements of local products and businesses Even the advent of technology has not changed the fact that we are biological creatures ruled by our biological clocks We are not alone in this Our basic instinct to sleep each day to recharge our physical batteries is shared by animals and plants in various ways The owl for example sleeps during the day and hunts at night while some flowers can be observed to close when the sun goes down Just like them we need to follow our natural demands and respect our biological clocks Whether we like it or not we are controlled by rather than in control of natural forces Most of us it seems would simply prefer things to remain the same the present situation looks more appealing We are afraid of rocking the boat Accordingly the present day with all its faults is generally more reassuring than a doubtful future Yet it is clear to me that we are living in a period of rapid change and that during such periods we become especially prone to feelings of nostalgia and fear of change Reminding ourselves of the good old days offers a convenient way for us to cling to some fantasy of order and control but it is no more than that Patients often ask me Why is everything I enjoy bad for me Well that s not necessarily true although it often seems that way For example you may eat all the chocolate you like as long as your body can stand the extra calories Do you like eggs If your cholesterol level is normal you may have three four or even five eggs a week People react differently to cholesterol in the diet In some it raises the blood levels while in others it does not So if you love eggs and chocolate eat some Just don t go overboard The picture storybook is an invitation to begin reading It is a primary source of involvement offering a way for the young child to approach a book to visualize a story and to revisit the story The tellers of these tales create stories that can be easily remembered and appeal to young children by means of text and illustrations These mutually supporting elements are often seen as separate aspects each telling the tale in its own way This has given rise to the name twice told tales However for the young child there is no separation of text and pictures which are as interdependent as the lyrics and melody that make up a song Children unlike adults view both as vital to the meaning of the story When a child is undecided about whether she likes the illustrations or the text better therefore we can be sure that a good match has been achieved The best picture books thus contain words and pictures which complement each other and are dependent upon each other to the point that one would be ineffective without the other It s frustrating You re excited about the work you ve just completed on your computer You start to print And suddenly it happens You run out of ink To make matters worse when you take the empty color cartridge out of the printer and shake it you can still hear ink inside Although only one color has run dry the whole cartridge is now useless Obviously throwing away unused ink translates into wasted money Well the good news is that we recently introduced a system whereby each color is separated into individual ink tanks They re called Eco Tanks and they dramatically reduce a printer s running costs How can young people without power and resources help to solve social problems Youngsters learn by digging in and finding out what the issues are all about And by being informed they can influence adults through direct action In fact given an opportunity young people many times have brought their thinking about significant issues to the attention of public officials Thanks to the actions of young people historical sites have been saved and several kinds of endangered plants and animals have been preserved People living along the coasts are familar with the rise and fall of the ocean s surface Tides result from the pull of the moon s and the sun s gravity on the earth Although the moon is much smaller than the sun it is much closer to the earth It is the moon that has the greatest effect on the tides The sun also influences the tides However it is so far away that it has less than half the pull of the moon The combined pull of the moon and the sun determines the height of the tides The Celtic New Year was November The night before was considered a special night when ghosts and witches roamed the earth Ghosts and witches are still associated with Halloween On the night before the Celtic New Year people went from house to house begging for food They wore masks so that the spirits returning from the dead would not recognize them Today children still wear masks and trick or treat from door to door on Halloween The Celts also carried lanterns to frighten away the spirits They carved the lanterns from vegetables like potatoes Now pumpkins hold lighted candles on Halloween In Europe two cars roll off the same assembly line at the same factory The cars have identical features The only difference is the name One is called Koba the other Fasta Despite their similarities the Fasta sells for over US more than the Koba and actual sales are double Do you know why Because the Fasta brand was one European consumers had come to trust they were willing to pay more A brand name instantly makes the product more recognizable and more desirable At the beginning of this decade one third of the doctors graduating from medical schools were women Now the figure is around percent Women doctors will soon be in the majority in some specialties and they are rapidly getting into traditionally male positions This shifting balance in what has been considered a male profession is changing medicine in a number of ways One can already see changes in medical education as the number of women professors in medical schools increases The more heartless our community becomes the less space we seem to have in our hearts for others Nearly all the people you happen to meet in life merit your consideration Many of them will be there to help you to deliver your pizza bag your groceries and make you coffee And millions more people most of whom you will never meet won t help you indeed can t help you and may not even be able to help themselves They also deserve your respect If you are not in the habit of being nice to all these people then get in the habit now Most people have great difficulties making their own decisions when they are not sure what to do They often let close friends and relatives influence them through opinions They even allow gossiping neighbors to express their thoughts for them If you are influenced by the opinions of others whenever you reach decisions you will not succeed in anything you do Remember you have a brain and mind of your own You should use it and reach your own decisions Dear Ms Burke Thank you for your question about how to donate children s books for our book drive The event will take place for one week from September th to th Books can be dropped off hours a day during this period There are two locations designated for donations Adams Children s Library and Aileen Community Center At each location there are blue donation boxes at the main entrance If you are unable to visit these locations books can be mailed directly to our organization Your donations will help support children in our community who may not be able to afford books We hope this information makes your donation easier We appreciate your support Best regards Carrie Wells Life is hectic Our days are filled with so many of the have tos that we feel there s no time left for the want tos Further spending all our time with others doesn t give us the ability to hit the reset button and relax Leaving little to no time for ourselves or for the things that are important to us can lead to unmanaged stress frustration fatigue resentment or worse health issues Building in regular you time however can provide numerous benefits all of which help to make life a little bit sweeter and a little bit more manageable Unfortunately many individuals struggle with reaching goals due to an inability to prioritize their own needs Alone time however forces you to take a break from everyday responsibilities and the requirements of others so you can dedicate time to move forward with your own goals meet your own personal needs and further explore your personal dreams Consumers like a bottle of wine more if they are told it cost ninety dollars a bottle than if they are told it cost ten Belief that the wine is more expensive turns on the neurons in the medial orbitofrontal cortex an area of the brain associated with pleasure feelings Wine without a price tag doesn t have this effect In American food and wine critics teamed up with a statistician from Yale and a couple of Swedish economists to study the results of thousands of blind tastings of wines ranging from to a bottle They found that when they can t see the price tag people prefer cheaper wine to pricier bottles Experts tastes did move in the proper direction they favored finer more expensive wines But the bias was almost imperceptible A wine that cost ten times more than another was ranked by experts only seven points higher on a scale of one to one hundred s critics separated themselves from the masses by rejecting the natural enjoyment afforded by products of mass culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism For example in most critics championing Douglas Sirk s films social critique self reflexivity and in particular distancing effects there is still a refusal of the vulgar enjoyments suspected of soap operas This refusal again functions to divorce the critic from an image of a mindless pleasure seeking crowd he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively secure the righteous logic of good taste It also pushes negative notions of female taste and subjectivity Critiques of mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption of the people The process of taste making operated then to create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd Radioactive waste disposal has become one of the key environmental battlegrounds over which the future of nuclear power has been fought Environmentalists argue that no system of waste disposal can be absolutely safe either now or in the future Governments and the nuclear industry have tried to find acceptable solutions But in countries where popular opinion is taken into consideration no mutually acceptable solution has been found As a result most spent fuel has been stored in the nuclear power plants where it was produced This is now causing its own problems as storage ponds designed to store a few years waste become filled or overflowing One avenue that has been explored is the reprocessing of spent fuel to remove the active ingredients Some of the recovered material can be recycled as fuel The remainder must be stored safely until it has become inactive But reprocessing has proved expensive and can exacerbate the problem of disposal rather than assisting it As a result it too appears publicly unacceptable As a couple start to form a relationship they can be seen to develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and in particular how it is similar or different to their parents relationship The couple s initial disclosures involve them forming constructs about how much similarity there is between them and each other s families What each of them will remember is selective and coloured by their family s constructs system In turn it is likely that as they tell each other their already edited stories there is a second process of editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again interpreted within their respective family of origin s construct systems The two sets of memories the person talking about his or her family and the partner s edited version of this story go into the cooking pot of the couple s new construct system Subsequently one partner may recall a part of the other s story as a tactic in negotiations for example Harry may say to Doris that she is being bossy just like her mother Since this is probably based on what Doris has told Harry this is likely to be a very powerful tactic She may protest or attempt to rewrite this version of her story thereby possibly adding further material that Harry could use in this way These exchanges of stories need not always be employed in such malevolent ways These reconstructed memories can become very powerful to a point where each partner may become confused even about the simple factual details of what actually did happen in their past Dear Teachers We are pleased to introduce our company s recently launched emergency training program for teachers Our CPR class is the most common option for a school We make it easy for teachers to participate in CPR training at a time to suit your school s schedule Our class offers you full life saving expertise that you can then use to deliver vital support in emergencies With the proper training you will be able to perform CPR quickly and effectively and improve a sufferer s chances of survival To learn more about our CPR course offerings please visit our website at www thebestCPRedu com Once you start to see praise for what it is and what it does these constant little evaluative outbursts from adults start to produce the same effect as fingernails being dragged down a blackboard You begin to root for a child to give his teachers or parents a taste of their own treacle by turning around to them and saying in the same saccharine tone of voice Good praising Still it s not an easy habit to break It can seem strange at least at first to stop praising it can feel as though you re being chilly or withholding something But that it soon becomes clear suggests that we praise more because we need to say it than because children need to hear it Whenever that s true it s time to rethink what we re doing What kids do need is unconditional support love with no strings attached That s not just different from praise it s the opposite of praise People sometimes make downward social comparisons comparing themselves to inferior or worse off others to feel better about themselves This is self enhancement at work But what happens when the only available comparison target we have is superior or better off than we are Can self enhancement motives still be served in such situations Yes they can as captured by the self evaluation maintenance model According to this theory we shift between two processes reflection and comparison in a way that lets us maintain favorable self views In areas that are not especially relevant to our self definition we engage in reflection whereby we flatter ourselves by association with others accomplishments Suppose you care very little about your own athletic skills but when your friend scores the winning goal during a critical soccer match you beam with pride experience a boost to your self esteem and take delight in her victory celebrations as if by association it were your victory too Some psychologists believe that insight is the result of a restructuring of a problem after a period of non progress where the person is believed to be too focused on past experience and get stuck A new manner to represent the problem is suddenly discovered leading to a different path to a solution heretofore unpredicted It has been claimed that no specific knowledge or experience is required to attain insight in the problem situation As a matter of fact one should break away from experience and let the mind wander freely Nevertheless experimental studies have shown that insight is actually the result of ordinary analytical thinking The restructuring of a problem can be caused by unsuccessful attempts in solving the problem leading to new information being brought in while the person is thinking The new information can contribute to a completely different perspective in finding a solution thus producing the Aha Experience When consumers lack adequate information to make informed choices governments frequently step in to require that firms provide information In the United States we are all familiar with the mandatory nutritional information placed on food products The Securities and Exchange Commission that monitors American stock markets forces firms to meet certain reporting requirements before their stock can be listed on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange Such reporting helps ensure that private investors have reliable information on which to base their investment decisions Often however these regulations do not work adequately as the Enron scandal in clearly illustrates The oil trading company Enron had cooked its books to overstate its profitability in its mandated reports One outcome of Enron s subsequent financial collapse was the introduction of new regulations designed to improve the reliability of the information that companies must provide to the public The weakness of local networks lies in their self containment for they lack input as well as outreach In a classic study of urban politics Herbert Gans found that neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city It was for this reason that Gans referred to them as urban villagers As the opposite of local networks cosmopolitan networks offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and sustain members But members benefit from a constant flow of new information and from the great reach of their influence even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in strength Local networks tend to be small In contrast cosmopolitan networks can be huge Thus while the urban villagers lacked ties even to their local city government cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the White House An ecosystem that is altered or damaged in some way will be out of balance with the biome for that area For example if the local biome is forest but the trees have been removed from one area then the ecosystem is out of balance The natural tendency is for plant species to move into that area bringing the ecosystem back towards the biome state The spread of a species into a new area is called colonisation It can happen naturally only if there are ecologically healthy ecosystems nearby to provide plant seeds Once the vegetation has started to recover insects birds and other animals will travel into the newly regenerated area These processes of ecological colonisation can be supported by environmental management For example we are currently seeing important changes in the way agriculture is carried out in Britain Rather than just maximising food production farming is becoming more environmentally friendly with the support of financial subsidies This new approach increases biological diversity by conserving hedges and the wildflowers insects birds and other animals that live on the land A proportion of agricultural land is left completely uncultivated so that species can gradually colonise it This provides a habitat for a wider range of species Leaving some farmland as set aside is also a way to decrease overall production when that is economically desirable Note that set aside land is more permanent than fallow land which is usually left for only a year Colonisation is a slow process taking place over years or even decades Dear Organizer My name is Cathy Cameron I m writing in regards to the Boston Red Sox Baseball Trip for the game with the Yankees taking place on Saturday September rd Unfortunately I have just become aware that your company s limit of people for registration has already been reached However I would really appreciate it if you could allow my son to register additionally He is a big fan of the Red Sox and this trip would make a great surprise gift for his birthday If there is any way that he is able to join the trip I would be very grateful I m sure it would give him the perfect birthday I look forward to hearing from you soon Yours sincerely Cathy Cameron My barely five year old son couldn t go to bed one night until he wrote I love you Mom on a piece of paper Pajamas on red crayon in hand he was very determined A few mixed up letters a couple of crumpled papers and some help from Daddy later he handed me his heart on the page Then finally he relaxed enough to fall asleep Sometimes saying how you feel just isn t enough Spoken words are invisible and untouchable Write it down however and you can see it feel it hold it keep it forever Although we may think it we can t really give someone our heart But by writing we can give someone our heart on a page A love note is a piece of paper that is a little piece of your heart Teach your child how to write love notes and I promise you will have many many happy returns One of the most demanding and at the same time inspiring aspects of translating for children is the potential for such creativity that arises from what Peter Hollindale has called the childness of children s texts the quality of being a child dynamic imaginative experimental interactive and unstable The unstable qualities of childhood that Hollindale cites require a writer or translator to have an understanding of the freshness of language to the child s eye and ear the child s affective concerns and the linguistic and dramatic play of early childhood Translating sound for example whether in the read aloud qualities of books for the younger child in animal noises children s poetry or in nonsense rhymes demands imaginative solutions as indeed does working with visual material Such multi faceted creativity has at times placed children s literature at the forefront of imaginative experimentation From an evolutionary perspective fear has contributed to both fostering and limiting change and to preserving the species We are programmed to be afraid It is a survival need as is stability which is another force of nature that can limit the capacity to change Stable patterns are necessary lest we live in chaos however they make it difficult to abandon entrenched behaviors even those that are no longer useful constructive or health creating And fear can keep you from changing when you don t want to risk a step into unknown territory for example some people choose not to leave an unfulfilling job or a failing relationship because they fear the unknown more than the known On the other hand fear can also motivate change in order to avoid something you re afraid of such as dying young as one of your parents might have A strategic vision has little value to the organization unless it s effectively communicated down the line to lower level managers and employees It would be difficult for a vision statement to provide direction to decision makers and energize employees toward achieving long term strategic intent unless they know of the vision and observe management s commitment to that vision Communicating the vision to organization members nearly always means putting where we are going and why in writing distributing the statement organizationwide and having executives personally explain the vision and its justification to as many people as possible Ideally executives should present their vision for the company in a manner that reaches out and grabs people s attention An engaging and convincing strategic vision has enormous motivational value for the same reason that a stone mason is inspired by building a great cathedral for the ages In science one experiment whether it succeeds or fails is logically followed by another in a theoretically infinite progression According to the underlying myth of modern science this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future In the arts by contrast no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better Given the methodologies of science the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works nobody ever would have written them Three composers attended a show at the Caf Concert des Ambassadeurs There they heard performances of a song written by one of them and a sketch written by the other two After the performance the three refused to pay their bill telling the owner of the caf You use the products of our labour without paying us for it So there s no reason why we should pay for your service The case went to court and the composers won on appeal The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works This decision created a new category of legal right the performing right and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner As a result of the decision these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights In doing so they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights based on the fact that with the possible exception of opera performances it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers bands promoters or in the twentieth century broadcasters Accordingly the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use issuing licences to music users negotiating fees collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people s businesses Dear Supporter I am writing to ask you to financially support the Marine Biodiversity Preservation Campaign Global marine biodiversity is increasingly endangered and coral reefs are among the most threatened marine environments on Earth This is particularly true for the reefs in the Coral Triangle Region With your donation we can preserve fragile coral reefs around the world For more information on how to donate please visit www marinebio org reefs Thank you Sincerely Braulio Ferreira Merely having goals clearly defined is not sufficient for one must also know moment by moment what precisely needs to be done For instance a salesperson s aim is to conclude a sale profitably However each sale requires a different approach Should he be pushy or laid back authoritative or friendly And what aspect of the product should he emphasize The answers to these questions depend on variables that cannot be predicted in advance This holds true not only for sales but also for most human activities One must select a particular strategy appropriate to the occasion and follow the chosen course of action Doing so will ensure more lasting success in reaching one s goals There is strong research evidence that children perform better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it It has been shown that mathematics is related with music in various known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that second year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano and read music improved their numeracy skills This could be so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and time and when pupils learn rhythm they are learning ratios fractions and proportions Other researchers investigated the ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate music into their regular math classrooms They concluded that music math integrated lessons had positive effects on three mathematical ability areas of modeling problem solving and application Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader People pay close attention to a leader s subtle expressions of emotion through body language and facial expression Some emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious Others such as depression or discouragement can drag down the entire organization Leaders with positive emotional states of mind are like human magnets People naturally gravitate to them and want to follow them Such leaders inspire enthusiasm in their organizations and attract the best people to work for them Conversely leaders who emit negative emotional states of mind who are irritable and bossy repel people and have few followers Effective coaches prioritize They focus on a single task instead of trying to multitask They understand that multitasking is another way of saying you are going to complete several tasks none of which are going to be very good Yuhong Jiang professor of psychology at Harvard University points out that the brain isn t built to concentrate on two things at once It works more slowly if it tries to Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done and separate out everything else Separating what s important from what s not important is prioritizing Ineffective coaches fail to put the big tasks first They either believe they have unlimited time thinking that they will have more time tomorrow to get something done or they underestimate how much time they really do have They have no ability to estimate how long a task will take Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of their ecosystem than others Such species called keystone species are vital in determining the nature and structure of the entire ecosystem The fact that other species depend on or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed when the keystone species is removed It is in this sense that we should draw attention to fig trees Different species of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain forests Although figs collectively produce a continuous crop of fruits fruit eating monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large quantities of figs in their diets During the time of year when other fruits are less plentiful however fig trees become important in sustaining fruit eating vertebrates Should the fig trees disappear most of the fruit eating vertebrates would be eliminated Protecting fig trees in such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates will survive True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of context The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is a telling example At the zoo visitors may witness a great beast pacing behind the bars of its cage They may observe and admire the creature its amazing bone structure and its magnificent coat However no matter how long visitors spend in front of that cage they will never truly understand the beast True understanding can only come from seeing the creature in its natural surroundings and in turn the ways in which its presence affects its environment What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true of science To fully understand science it must be considered within the society in which it functions Science is not conducted in a vacuum It is embedded within a social fabric and just as a flesh and blood beast influences and is influenced by its environment so too do science and society mutually influence one another Society through ethical and economic constraints exerts a powerful influence on what science accomplishes At the same time the results of science have profound and sometimes unexpected impacts on every human being on earth Therefore to make sense of science related issues it is critical to recognize the bidirectional relationship between science and society If you re one of the countless people whose mind and body have been overworked you need a program that will give you a more positive and energetic life the Health Management Program offered by the ABC Well Being Institute This program lasts for six weeks and consists of three different components Daily Targets Walking Plans and Eating Plans Each week you ll be advised by our health experts and introduced to new physical activity targets Are you serious about improving your life immediately Then you can start by enrolling in our fantastic program today Everybody has moments of doubt about something or other from time to time it is a natural process The challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and affect your self belief You will always face the challenge of other people s comments and opinion There are people that you feel good being around and others you don t Some people give you positive energy because they believe in you You feel it and you rise to the occasion Others may always have a negative comment to make about what you are doing or talking about Don t let these comments rock your self belief Always question the person s reason for the comment If it is based on fact you should listen if not then it is only their opinion You will need to stay strong One reason many people keep delaying things they should do is that they fear they will do them wrong or poorly so they just don t do them at all For example one of the best ways to write a book is to write it as quickly as possible getting your thoughts onto paper without regard to style Then you can go back to revise and polish your writing If I only wrote when I knew it would be perfect I d still be working on my first book Do you have a hard time relaxing if your house is a mess Do you beat yourself up for making mistakes I ve got a simple message for you today It s time to let go of your perfectionism It becomes a stumbling block that keeps you stuck Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just protecting the body Dress and textiles alike are used as a means of nonverbal communication Obvious examples would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular social role and the modern white wedding dress Western cultures use to mark this rite of passage Both types of clothing communicate important information nonverbally to the onlooker The female wearing the white dress is about to be married and change her status and role in society The person in the uniform has some specialized function in society such as police officer nurse or soldier Therefore it can be said that clothing visually communicates information about group membership and functions as an identity marker Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty The concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money culture In traditional societies where resources continued to be scarce consumption was more seasonally and communally orientated In years of bountiful crops people ate heartily and in lean years they starved People were not particularly motivated to produce more goods for stockpiling as there was little incentive to do so where there was little security from raids When times were good celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season when stocks could not be refilled These rituals were more important than the potential hardships such celebrations might later bring as they served to bind people together and distribute resources Holiday rituals were typically structured around cultural practices such as song dance theater and feasting and took a great deal of time away from work Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits the mind by catching the reader s attention and triggering moments of self reflection The brain activity of volunteers was monitored as they read classical works These same texts were then translated into more straightforward modern language and again the readers brains were monitored as they read the words Scans showed that the more challenging prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the readers encountered unusual words surprising phrases or difficult sentence structures This lighting up lasts long enough to shift the brain into a higher gear encouraging further reading The research also found that reading the more challenging version of poetry in particular increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain helping the readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they have read The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self help books Organisms must compete for resources not only with members of their own species but with members of other species When two species use the same resource and the resource is scarce the species must compete just as if they were members of the same population One of the two species usually turns out to be better at the competition If two species eat exactly the same food for example one of the two will be better at catching it Unless something interferes the inferior competitor loses out and the competitively superior species takes over When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it it is called competitive exclusion Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented from excluding poorer competitors Periodic disturbances such as severe storms battering by drifting logs or underwater landslides can reduce the population of a dominant competitor and give other species a chance Furthermore which species is competitively superior sometimes depends on the conditions On rocky shores in tropical Hong Kong for example foliose leaf like algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively cool winter In the summer heat these forms die out and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from excluding the other and there is a shifting balance between the competing species B Even when scientists are able to identify seemingly beneficial nutrients they cannot always understand how those nutrients will operate in a real life context in the course of our daily meals Fruits and vegetables are believed to help prevent cancer Scientists have believed that it is the antioxidants in these foods that make the difference compounds like beta carotene lycopene and vitamin E Yet when these molecules were extracted from fruits and vegetables and made into supplements they did not reduce cancer The beta carotene supplement actually increased the risk of certain cancers In other words scientists thoroughly misunderstood the causes of complex events They identified one element engaged in the process of nutrition without fully comprehending how the system as a whole truly functions Nutritional scientists pursuing the hot paradigm of isolating nutrients failed to see a multitude of links in the complex chain that leads to good health Artists create artistic works to get viewers to have certain kinds of experiences But the intention to convey certain experiences to viewers is sometimes secondary to the intention to express the artistic imagination creatively Consider actions generally for the moment Think for example of people watching their favorite sporting team Whether it is at an actual match or in a bar at crucial periods in a game people tend to make gestures in anticipation or cheer in exhortation They often want to convey their sense of urgency to the team or people at the bar may want to show their disgust to others in the crowd But they often express themselves in this manner without any thought for what others think or how they may respond Actions we perform through which we intend to express our feelings thoughts and attitudes need not have any communicative intent for how others may respond At least some works should be understood as the representation of just this kind of action A Hi boys and girls My name is Adam Burke Are you interested in buying a special lunch bag to protect our environment When I was in sixth grade I noticed that many of my classmates carried paper lunch bags I found out that from sandwich wrappers to disposable drink containers the average school kid generates pounds of lunch bag waste every year To help kids cut down on lunch bag waste I have invented a reusable lunch bag which I am now selling on my website It has handles and a front pocket And the fabric is partially made from recycled plastic bottles You will like it because you can fold it up and put it in your backpack If you d like to buy one please feel free to visit www myblog com aburke When people expect to see someone again they are more likely to find that person attractive regardless of the individual s behavior than if they do not have expectations of future interaction The expectation of future interaction motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone so that they will look forward to future interactions rather than dread them and increases the chances that people will find the individual attractive Conversely when people interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting again they have little reason to search for positive qualities In fact doing so may be depressing given that they may not have the opportunity to get to know the person better in future interactions Indeed people are sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in individuals whom they do not expect to see again Lone animals rely on their own senses to defend themselves but an animal in a group benefits by having a lot of other animals eyes ears and noses on the alert for danger An animal in a group also has a smaller chance of being the unlucky individual picked out by a predator In addition a group of animals fleeing from a predator can create confusion This makes it harder for a predator to focus on one animal to catch A school of fish will split in two to avoid a predator and then quickly regroup behind it A herd of zebras can become a dazzling display of black and white stripes making it more difficult for a lion to see where one zebra ends and another begins If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position take a look at their writing skills It doesn t matter if that person is a marketer salesperson designer programmer or whatever their writing skills will pay off That s because being a good writer is about more than writing Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking Good writers know how to communicate They make things easy to understand They can put themselves in someone else s shoes They know what to omit And those are qualities you want in any candidate Writing is making a comeback all over our society Look at how much communication happens through instant messaging and blogging Writing is today s currency for good ideas Thus it is essential to welcome people with good writing skills into your company Effective communication is vital to achieving wellness because our daily interactions with others are important factors in our emotional health People who have developed a high degree of communication skills are more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in their personal relationships than non communicators Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes from our close relationships which are the main source of our emotional health Close relationships develop when two people can exchange emotional messages easily and effectively Whether we develop effective communication skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on how we learn to communicate For example interaction between parents and their children is often important in determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of interaction Good parents listen to their children and allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness Children raised in households that foster communication find it easier to talk to others about their disappointments fears frustrations and other emotions later in life Such individuals find that they ultimately have better emotional health Dear Mr Johnson I can t tell you how sorry I was to learn that the flood caused almost total damage to your home I can only imagine what a terrible loss it must be The very prospect of losing everything and having to start all over again would be overwhelming for anybody That is why I want to provide you with any assistance that I can I have an extra bedroom that you are welcome to use As your friends and neighbors join forces to support you in your time of need I m sure that everything will seem a little brighter with each new day In the meantime please take good care of yourself With all good wishes Richard Jackson We often dismiss new ideas that could further our growth simply because they do not fit within the general framework of our preconceived notions and self concepts An enormous amount of time is spent simply reacting It s as if we are robots programmed to respond on cue to whatever demands the least time and attention and disregard anything that requires putting in extra time and energy to think We skim over the surface thoughtlessly But we must acknowledge that thinking well is a time consuming process We can t expect instant results We have to slow down a bit and take the time to contemplate and meditate It is the only path to a more meaningful and efficient existence Masks are too heavy to uphold indefinitely and no matter how well you believe you are disguising yourself others always know The consequences are that you waste energy sacrifice productivity and lose people s trust In our study all of the CEOs were concerned that dropping their masks would make them appear weak In every case however the leader s subordinates perceived the removal of the mask as an act of strength and courage This in turn encouraged a culture where those subordinates did the same creating a snowball effect Some of the ways we helped the CEOs remove their masks were to actually name the masks explore the significant personal and professional costs of upholding them and ask the CEOs to reflect on the leader they most admired At this point each of the CEOs was ready to rebuild a leadership identity based on values strengths and ambitions We sometimes encounter students who come to our offices and ask how they could have worked so hard but still failed our tests They usually tell us that they read and reread the textbook and their class notes and that they thought they understood everything well by the time of the exam And they probably did internalize some bits and pieces of the material but the illusion of knowledge led them to confuse the familiarity they had gained from repeated exposure to the concepts in the course with an actual understanding of them As a rule reading text over and over again yields diminishing returns in actual knowledge but it increases familiarity and fosters a false sense of understanding Only by testing ourselves can we actually determine whether or not we really understand That is one reason why teachers give tests and why the best tests probe knowledge at a deep level Hundreds of species of small fishes exist in well defined social organizations called schools Fish schools vary in size from a few individuals to enormous populations extending over several square kilometers Schools usually consist of a single species with all members similar in size or age For small animals with no other means of individual defense schooling behavior provides a degree of protection Predatory fishes have less chance of encountering prey if the prey are members of a school because the individuals of the prey species are concentrated in compact units rather than dispersed over a much larger area Moreover once a predator encounters a school satiation of the predator enables most members of the school to escape unharmed Large numbers of fishes in a school may achieve additional survival advantages by confusing predators with continually shifting and changing positions they might even discourage hungry predators with the illusion of an impressively large and formidable opponent Restoration assumes that one can recreate an artist s original intent and product At best restorers and museum directors aesthetic preferences and historical theories drive restorations for it is impossible to step outside one s historical context How can restorers be so sure that removing a layer of lacquer isn t merely their subconscious attempt to refashion an artwork according to contemporary tastes What s restorative about that The restored Sistine Chapel may look authentic today but will it still look so when aesthetic and historical theories have changed Surely the best approach with any great work of art is to simply leave it alone Your culture maintains an implicit schedule for the right time to do many important things for example the right time to start dating to finish college to buy your own home or to have a child This unspoken timetable provides you with a social clock a schedule that tells you if you re keeping pace with your peers are ahead of them or are falling behind On the basis of this social clock you evaluate your own social and professional development If you keep up with the rest of your peers then you ll feel well adjusted competent and a part of the group If you re late you ll probably experience feelings of dissatisfaction Although in some cultures the social clock is becoming more flexible and more tolerant of deviations from the conventional timetable it still exerts pressure to keep pace with your peers Many of us believe that amnesia or sudden memory loss results in the inability to recall one s name and identity This belief may reflect the way amnesia is usually portrayed in movies television and literature For example when we meet Matt Damon s character in the movie The Bourne Identity we learn that he has no memory for who he is why he has the skills he does or where he is from He spends much of the movie trying to answer these questions However the inability to remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in reality Amnesia most often results from a brain injury that leaves the victim unable to form new memories but with most memories of the past intact Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days which you would think is a good thing But the very reversibility of our romantic commitments has only worsened our problem because that also undermines our satisfaction with our choices To see this you only need to look at a study of a group of college students in a photography class The students made a print of their two best photographs They were then told that they could choose one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file as an example of their work Then the teacher added a twist One group was told that their choice was final Whatever they chose they could not change their minds later The other group was told that they could switch photographs if they changed their minds In a survey taken later students who were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less than the other students Why this paradoxical result According to one researcher the brain has a kind of built in defense system that works to make us satisfied with choices that cannot be undone Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change our minds it appears that we are happier with our choices if we think they can t be changed which means we would be better off if we made romantic commitments more permanent and more difficult to break rather than less So you re ready to add a new member a furry one to your family But now you have one more decision to make What kind of dog should I get Here are some tips to consider when choosing a dog that is right for you First pick a dog that fits your home Bring a big one into your house only if you can give him a lot of space Second don t buy a shaggy dog if you re allergic Getting a non shedding dog is a good idea if you re worried about loose hairs or your kids allergies Third pick a mild mannered puppy that is likely to be more forgiving and protective of his little owners Keep these in mind and you ll enjoy having the new member at home Effective leaders set the tone for the entire organization It s not a matter of knowing more than everyone else There are plenty of leaders who are not the biggest experts in their companies But it does mean working hard something anyone can do Be the first person to arrive at the workplace and be the last one to leave If you can do that you will already be light years ahead of most managers in the respect you will gain from your team members Apply the same principle to all your routine activities If you expect your sales force to make calls each day make calls yourself It is not rocket science It is just basic lead by example management No one can really discredit leaders who are the hardest working individuals in their organizations Some species seem to have a stronger influence than others on their ecosystem Take away the sea stars along the northwest coast of the United States for instance and the ecosystem changes dramatically in the absence of these sea stars their favorite prey mussels takes over and makes it hard for other species that used to live there Sea stars are known as keystone species because as top predators they determine ecosystem structure by their eating habits If you chop down an aspen tree by a beaver pond not much will happen but if you take away a beaver a wetland might dry out changing the kinds of plants that live there and the animals that rely on them Because beavers exert their influence by physically altering the landscape they are known as ecosystem engineers Despite the fact that ancient civilizations relied upon the apparent motion of celestial bodies through the sky to determine seasons months and years we know little about the details of timekeeping in prehistoric eras But wherever we turn up records and artifacts we usually discover that in every culture some people were preoccupied with measuring the passage of time Ice age hunters in Europe over years ago scratched lines and made holes in sticks and bones possibly counting the days between phases of the moon Five thousand years ago Sumerians in the Tigris Euphrates valley had a calendar that divided the year into day months and the day into periods We have no written records of Stonehenge built over years ago in England but its alignments show its purposes apparently included the determination of seasonal or celestial events Despite what you might think luck isn t a matter of fate or destiny according to research by psychologist Richard Wiseman Instead it s a result of the way lucky people think and act which means that anyone can learn to be lucky For instance Wiseman found that lucky people always take notice of what s going on around them and stay open to new experiences and opportunities Meanwhile unlucky people tend to be tenser and too focused on certain tasks which stops them from noticing opportunities they aren t explicitly looking for So next time you re heading to a party don t go in with a goal in mind no matter how much you want to attract someone Instead take things as they come and you never know what might happen You could even make some awesome new friends In a study conducted by Karen O Quinn and Joel Aronoff participants were asked to negotiate with a seller over the purchase price of a piece of art Toward the end of the negotiation the seller made a final offer in one of two ways Half of the time he said that he would accept while the other half of the time he gave the same final price but also added a little humor Well my final offer is and I ll throw in my pet frog Those few moments of attempted humor had a large effect as participants made a much greater compromise in their purchase price when they heard about the frog It seemed that the brief humorous comment momentarily put the participants in a good mood and encouraged them to be more giving The green revolution was a mixed blessing Over time farmers came to rely heavily on broadly adapted high yield crops to the exclusion of varieties adapted to local conditions Monocropping vast fields with the same genetically uniform seeds helps boost yield and meet immediate hunger needs Yet high yield varieties are also genetically weaker crops that require expensive chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides The same holds true for high yield livestock breeds which often require expensive feed and medicinal care to survive in foreign climates The drive to increase production is pushing out local varieties diluting livestock s genetic diversity in the process As a result the world s food supply has become largely dependent on a shrinking list of breeds designed for maximum yield In short in our focus on increasing the amount of food we produce today we have accidentally put ourselves at risk for food shortages in the future About twenty years ago Time magazine described a study by a psychologist of people who had lost their jobs three times due to plant closings The writers were amazed by what they discovered They expected the people being laid off to be beaten down and discouraged Instead they found them to be incredibly resilient Why was that They concluded that people who had weathered repeated adversity had learned to bounce back People who had lost a job and found a new one twice before were much better prepared to deal with adversity than someone who had always worked at the same place and had never faced adversity It may sound ironic but if you have experienced a lot of failure you are actually in a better position to achieve success than people who have not A bumper sticker reading Don t Believe Everything You Think is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in Greene s office It represents the underlying message of the book he is writing An analogy carried throughout the book compares the moral brain to a camera with automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or an indoor portrait or a close up of a flower and manual settings for unusual conditions or when we want a nonstandard artistic effect Greene believes emotions and intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while reasoning is the manual mode We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we could not function But they are not always trustworthy moral indicators since they were set to handle problems deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for the newer complexities of the modern world We need to rely on our manual settings the reasoning sections of our brain for more complex or novel situations Greene says The McDonald s restaurants that are located across the United States and increasingly the world have a significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick hamburgers milk shakes and salads As sociologist George Ritzer says our everyday lives are being McDonaldized The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to the robotlike assembly of food This term refers to the standardization of everyday life a process that is transforming our lives Want to do some shopping Shopping malls offer one stop shopping in controlled environments Planning a trip Travel agencies offer package tours They will transport middle class Americans to ten European capitals in fourteen days All visitors experience the same hotels restaurants and other scheduled sites Efficiency brings dependability You can expect your burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them in Los Angeles or Beijing Although efficiency also lowers prices it does come at a cost Predictability washes away spontaneity changing the quality of our lives It produces a sameness a bland version of what used to be unique experiences In my own travels for example had I taken packaged tours I never would have had the eye opening experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of human diversity For good or bad our lives are being McDonaldized and the predictability of packaged settings seems to be our social destiny Our coming prepackaged society will be efficient of course But it also means that we will be trapped in the iron cage of bureaucracy just as Weber warned would happen I was pleased to receive your letter requesting a letter of reference for a Future Leaders scholarship As your physics teacher I can certainly speak highly of your academic abilities Your grades have consistently been A s and B s in my class Since this is the first semester that I have had you in class however I do not feel that I am the right person to provide information on your leadership skills I would encourage you to request a reference letter from those teachers with whom you have had the most opportunity to demonstrate those skills I am sure many teachers would be willing to provide letters for you Good luck with your scholarship Comparing yourself with others is natural and can be motivational However too much of it leads to envy especially if you re ungenerous toward yourself Instead try measuring your present self against your past self When I asked a salesperson to map his sales performance he was amazed to see that he had achieved a to annual increase in sales while at his firm This made him feel more self confident and lessened his resentment toward his colleagues If you feel threatened every time a perceived rival does well remind yourself of your own strengths and successes While predictions about the future are always difficult one can be made with certainty People will find themselves in large numbers of interactions where intercultural communication skills will be essential There are several reasons for such prediction Some reasons include increasing amounts of contact brought on by overseas assignments in the business world the movement of college students spending time in other countries and increasing amounts of international travel among tourists Others relate to social changes within any one large and complex nation affirmative action the movement of immigrants and refugees bilingual education programs and movement away from the goal that ethnic minorities become a part of a melting pot Therefore it is essential that people research the cultures and communication conventions of those whom they propose to meet in the future A famous psychiatrist was leading a symposium on the methods of getting patients to open up about themselves The psychiatrist challenged his colleagues with a boast I ll bet that my technique will enable me to get a new patient to talk about the most private things during the first session without my having to ask a question What was his magic formula Simply this He began the session by revealing to the patient something personal about himself secrets with which the patient might damage the doctor by breaking the confidence As he was maskless patients began to talk about their lives They opened themselves up to him because he had become an open minded person himself and openness evoked openness The same principle applies to all human relationships If you dare to take the initiative in self revelation the other person is much more likely to reveal secrets to you After an event all one has are memories of it Because most waits expect a desired outcome it is the memory of the outcome that dominates not the intermediate components If the overall outcome is pleasurable enough any unpleasantness suffered along the way is minimized Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson call this rosy retrospection Mitchell and his colleagues studied participants in a day tour of Europe students going home for Thanksgiving vacation and a three week bicycle tour across California In all of these cases the results were similar Before an event people looked forward with positive anticipation Afterward they remembered fondly During Well reality seldom lives up to expectations so plenty of things go wrong As memory takes over however the unpleasantness fades and the good parts remain perhaps to intensify and even get amplified beyond reality Every day it seems we learn of an apology from a prominent figure in response to an indiscretion of some sort Those in the public eye have an unfortunate tendency to apologize only after they have been found with a hand in the cookie jar When this happens it is only natural for a skeptical public to wonder Are they apologizing for their conduct or simply because they were caught To make matters worse the wrongdoer will often use the passive voice in his or her apology Mistakes were made rather than I made a mistake It is more comfortable to use the passive voice here but doing so relinquishes any sense of personal responsibility It is a non apology and is not very meaningful We can infer that there was prosperity in ancient Athens because this was a time that saw the planting of many olive trees Since olive trees do not produce their fruits for about thirty years their planting indicates that people were optimistic about the future The growth in the export of olive oil also encouraged the development of pottery in which the oil was transported About B C came the invention of red figure vase painting Now the whole surface of the vase was blackened with figures picked out in the natural red This allowed much more variety and realism And the prosperity brought about by the international trade in olive oil spread to the peasants and it was their rituals with choral song and mimic dancing that formed the basis of early theater Until recently it was generally assumed that the first humans took a northerly route to leave the African continent walking into the Middle East and then spreading out from there However mtDNA analysis now suggests the exodus may have proceeded via a more southerly route In an international team of researchers announced that an isolated group living in Malaysia appeared to be the descendants of humans who left Africa around years ago According to the researchers climatic change underway at the time would have made a southerly route easier The genetic evidence suggests perhaps as few as several hundred individuals went first to India then Southeast Asia and Australasia If correct this would explain why humans appear to have reached Australia around years ago while the oldest human remains in Europe a jawbone found in Romania are only around years old The information processing model emphasizes rational analysis for solving problems with an emphasis on techniques for quickly arriving at a solution Culturally this orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which are normally valued by contemporary Western societies For example Westerners tend to admire someone who is independent and quick thinking But these characteristics are not universally valued Agricultural African societies for example valued looking at the problem in the context of the whole society noting its impact on various features of life In most situations speed in arriving at a solution was not a vital issue This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in Canada These groups historically lived in wilderness areas and faced many hardships in these circumstances they would rarely get a second chance at solving problems Consequently these Native people value taking time to reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible solutions before any action is taken The other day an acquaintance of mine a sociable and charming man told me he had found himself unexpectedly alone in New York for an hour or two between appointments He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the empty time looking at things by himself For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone What had he been afraid of I asked myself That suddenly alone he would discover that he bored himself or that there was quite simply no self there to meet But having taken the first step into this new world he is now about to begin a new adventure he is about to be launched into his own inner space space as immense unexplored and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut His every perception will come to him with a new freshness and for a time seem startlingly original For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes for a moment or two something of a genius With another human being present vision becomes double vision inevitably We are busy wondering what does my companion see or think of this and what do I think of it The original impact gets lost Music I heard with you was more than music Exactly And therefore music itself can only be heard alone Solitude is the salt of personhood It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience We are addicted to our cars We do not think twice before driving to pick something up at a store that is only three blocks away In fact we romanticize driving with our thoughts of long Sunday drives and adventurous cross country road trips Well we need to get rid of this addiction and fast because driving is harmful to our health and to our planet s health The air pollutants that spit out from the car exhaust pipes have been proven to cause cancer and the carbon dioxide that is emitted causes global warming One of the easiest ways to reduce these emissions is simply to change our mind set about driving We need to make driving our last choice of transportation to live a happy healthy life And the first step in achieving this new mind set is to reorganize our lives so we do not need to drive much or far Growing native plants in a garden is catching on like wildfire Natives often attract more birds and pollinators such as bees and butterflies increasing their diversity to your garden Imitating a native landscape in an isolated urban yard however does not do all that much to make up for lost native habitat So what is the most ecological use of your garden At the top of the list is gardening for your own food There is no reason that what you plant for birds butterflies and bees cannot also feed you and your family Sunflowers are often called nature s bird feeders but you can plant enough to share the oil rich seeds Many fruit trees in your garden can also feed both birds and you Conditioning occurs indirectly which adds to its impact on us Let s say for example that you watch another person get an electric shock Each time a signal light comes on before the shock is delivered Even if you do not receive a shock yourself you will soon develop an emotional response to the light Children who learn to fear thunder by watching their parents react to it have undergone similar conditioning If horror movies can affect us we might expect the emotions of parents friends and relatives to have even more impact How for instance does a city child learn to fear snakes and respond emotionally to mere pictures of them Being told that snakes are dangerous may not explain the child s emotional response More likely the child has observed others reacting fearfully to the word snake or to snake images on television Travel around the country with Carl Sandburg a twentiethcentury poet who has been called the voice of America Hop aboard his poetry train on which each amazing poem leads to a different destination some quiet and peaceful others alive with enthusiasm and humor Visit rural back roads and busy cities and meet friendly animals and ordinary people going about their daily lives More than thirty wonderful poems are presented in this collection of his poetry along with special illustrations that capture the spirit of the poetry With a magic touch Sandburg manages to find the laughter and meaning in everyday things doors rain colors the sea a telephone wire words and even a rat So pack your imagination and get ready to take a special trip with the words of Carl Sandburg We know where we are headed and what we want to do However quite often due to forces outside our control things do not go as we had planned and we have to adjust to a postponement or create a whole new set of circumstances This is what happens when life throws us a curveball The fact is that life is unpredictable For example your car breaks down and you are late for an appointment While it is true that you never arrive at that important meeting you end up spending a few relaxing hours with people you would never have met otherwise Remember that not only are curveballs the universe s way of keeping us awake which is a gift in and of itself but they are also its method of bringing us wonderful surprises When my son was seven years old we went to a dolphin show After the show I went up to the trainer and asked How did you get the dolphin to do all these really neat things The trainer looked at my son and me and said Unlike many parents whenever the dolphin does anything like what I want him to do I notice him I give him a hug and a fish The light went on in my head Whenever my son did what I wanted him to do I paid little attention to him However when he did not I gave him a lot of attention because I did not want to raise a bad kid I was unintentionally teaching him to be a little monster in order to get my attention Since that day I have tried hard to notice my son s good acts and downplay his mistakes The person who wrote of a building bringing gladness to the viewer reminds us of the importance of beauty in human life Biologists account for the human desire for art in other terms They explain that human beings have very large brains that demand stimulation Curious active and inventive we humans constantly explore and in so doing invent things that appeal to our senses fine arts fine food fine scents and fine music Art has mostly been considered in terms of seeking beauty but there are other reasons deeply rooted in the human experience that create needs for art For one humans also reflect on the nature of things and the meaning of life Visually and verbally we constantly communicate with each other in our need to understand and our need to communicate the arts serve a vital function It is possible to observe a basic and sometimes unexplainable division in the animal world Some species crowd together and require physical contact with each other Others avoid touching No apparent logic governs the category into which a species falls Curiously enough closely related animals may belong to different categories The great Emperor penguin is a contact species It conserves heat through contact with its fellows in large groups The smaller Adelie penguin is a non contact species Thus it is somewhat less adaptable to cold than the Emperor Other functions served by contact behavior are unknown One could guess that since contact animals are more involved with each other their social organization and possibly their manner of exploiting the environment might be different from those of non contact animals The face of the water in time became a wonderful book a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger but which told its mind to the pilot without reserve delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it spoke them with a voice The passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds To the pilot however it was a highlighted passage Indeed it was more than that for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes and the most frightening to a pilot s eye As we explore together the virtual world that floats on the edge of this material life the many imaginative territories you inhabit bring back another reality I catch images of my own childhood wanderings through Narnia the land of hobbits and Mowgli s jungle All these are deep pleasures which combine all my senses and momentarily transport me into another dimension of living If I were to bring it all together I would say that among all the misery fear injustice and pain I hope you will not forget moments when all this fades away into periods of innocent joy It is when we bring all our powerful senses together perhaps in a moment in the garden of earthly delights that we triumph over despair So the moment when you dance to Handel or when you sit in a pool of wild flowers or gravely take part in your first tea ceremony these are the moments you will treasure They are with similar moments with friends and loved ones what makes being human bearable Many people may have had the experience of buying products that fell apart after hardly any use Although the manufacture and sale of such products do not violate the law intentionally making false claims for a product is fraud Some frauds endanger the health and even the lives of citizens Some drug companies have for example frequently been caught making false claims about their products or hiding information to cover up their dangers Although companies are supposed to seek profits they still need to be morally responsible Everybody must be a good citizen concerned with the health and welfare of all As members of society companies should be no less concerned Urban rural differences in child growth patterns have been known for more than a century While urban rural differences are well known the extent of the differences between urban and rural samples varies according to specific features that characterize the urban and rural communities Thus urban rural differences may be non existent as they often are in contemporary comparisons involving children from long industrialized countries Or they may be substantial as they frequently were in American and European countries years ago or as they are today in developing countries In these developing countries there may be large differences in nutrition medical care pollutant exposure parental characteristics and energy use With this in mind generalization about urban rural differences is difficult If you read lifestyle magazines you will see how often prominent people meet up with other prominent people That is the secret for building up a network It is through these meetings that prominent people become prominent in the first place You might write a bestseller make a fantastic appearance on television hold seminars that are so good that they become legendary or have incredible success in business But if you are isolated in your private life afterwards your success will not last long Networking should not be regarded as a search for customers or partners but rather as a win win situation from which everyone can benefit I m not suggesting that you have to watch the news constantly but by reading listening and talking we keep up with what s happening Successful people don t get stuck by the unimportant details of their own lives and they don t live in a tiny bubble Make it your mission to know what s going on in the world in current events music fashion science food transport and even TV Successful people are able to hold a conversation pretty well on everything and anything because they re interested in what s going on You don t necessarily have to own the latest everything but you should have a rough idea of what s changing what s new and what s happening both in your community and on the other side of the world For decades critics have been predicting the death of classical music suggesting that the classical music audience has grown old with no younger generation to take its place They point out that orchestras are debt burdened that major record labels are cutting back or cutting out their classical operations and that the number of radio stations with classical programming is decreasing The critics conclude that classical music is no longer popular What these critics seem entirely ignorant of however is that the worldly and educated so called Generation Y is more apt to take an interest in classical music and as more and more classical organizations take the initiative to capitalize on this the future is beginning to look promising The stories you will read here are based on facts from eyewitness accounts They have been collected from a wide variety of employees and organizations across the United States The names and in some cases genders have been changed to protect the identities of the individuals These accounts are only a small sampling of general practices currently in operation in American Business and do not reflect an experience within any particular company While these stories expose the darker side of American Business this book does not offer legal advice Any reader who feels she or he needs legal advice should consult legal counsel Nicknames and their associated identities in the emerging medium of online communication have become an important means in identifying the participants in online chat rooms and newsgroups H Bays a sociolinguist observes that online a nickname can be anything from numbers and punctuation to a highly personal or expressive name and potentially contains numerous sociological cues such as gender approximate age music and sports interests Examples may include snowwhite lion musiclover and Birdie sunneyman She further points out that the nickname is the first sign of individuality when one encounters another participant It serves as a first impression and shows the aspect of face that the participant wants to present online While we generally equate myths with the ancient Greeks or Romans modern myths are realized in many aspects of popular culture including trademarks movies comic books holidays and even commercials Commercials and advertisements can be analyzed in terms of the underlying mythic themes they represent Often fashion ads especially perfume ads use fantasy and mythical themes Comic book superheroes also demonstrate how myths can be communicated to consumers of all ages Indeed some of these fictional characters represent a mono myth a myth that is common to many cultures The most prevalent mono myth involves a hero who emerges from the everyday world with supernatural powers and wins a decisive victory over evil forces Comic book heroes familiar to most consumers may even be more credible and effective than real life celebrities Anchoring settling to a certain price range influences all kinds of purchases Uri Simonsohn and George Lowenstein for example found that people who move from inexpensive areas to moderately priced cities do not increase their spending to fit the new area Rather these people spend an amount similar to what they were used to in their previous area even if this means having to squeeze themselves and their families into smaller or less comfortable homes Likewise people moving from more expensive cities sink the same amount of dollars into their new housing situations as they did in the past People who move from an expensive area do not generally downsize their spending much once they move to a moderately priced city Although most people use the bus or subway to get around Seoul every once in a while it s nice to spend a sunny day crossing the city on a bicycle While riding you are certain to discover new streets and different views of the capital The key to enjoying cycling is to choose the right streets says one city official adding that alleys off main roads can be interesting areas to explore If you only ride occasionally you don t have to spend a lot of money because bikes can be rented Let s discover Seoul and learn about its undiscovered back streets on a bike Children grow up and leave home They go from helpless babies to mature adults while our back is turned The secret is to try and keep pace with them We have to resist the urge to do everything for them and let them fry eggs or paint trash cans for themselves By the time they reach adolescence we may expect them to be able to keep their room tidy for the first time But they have never done it before They have to learn how to do it and part of that learning process is not doing it doing it badly and doing it differently from how we would do it Growing is a messy business Our job is to help them that is to hand them responsibility slowly bit by bit Many years ago my drama director frustrated with my bad acting in a play shouted No No Your body is contradicting your words Every tiny movement reveals your private thoughts Then he said something I ll never forget The way you move is your autobiography in motion How right he was On the stage of real life every physical move you make subconsciously tells everyone the story of your life As dogs hear sounds our ears can t detect people make and notice moves that are beneath human consciousness but have tremendous power to attract or offend Science is all about trying ideas abandoning those that don t work and building on those that do It never stops Those people in the past who had wrong ideas weren t fools They were doing the best they could given the knowledge of their times We do the same thing today And you can be sure that people in the future will look back and wonder why we believe some of the things we do Does that make science unimportant If some of our scientific theories are going to be proved false why bother studying them If you believe something is an absolute truth you can just memorize it and get on with your life After all there is always something to explore in the world What is value to the customer is the most important question in business yet is rarely asked One reason is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer Value is what they in their business define as quality But this is almost always the wrong definition The customer never buys a product but the satisfaction of a want For the teenage girl for instance value in a shoe is high fashion Price is a secondary consideration and durability is not value at all For the same girl as a young mother a few years later what she looks for is durability price and comfort By thinking the right thoughts you can make any job less distasteful Your boss wants you to be more interested in your job so that he or she will make more money But let s forget about what the boss wants Think only of what getting interested in your job will do for you Remind yourself that it may double the amount of happiness you get out of life for you spend about one half of your waking hours at work Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off your worries and in the long run will probably bring about promotion and increased pay Even if it doesn t do that it will reduce fatigue to a minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure Sleep recharges our brains and helps us think more clearly But more importantly it is a time when noise from the world outside is shut off and creative energy from the deepest inner mind can break through It s no wonder why you often wake up with great ideas after a sound sleep Or why Elias Howe thought of the idea of a sewing machine after waking up Or why Dmitri Mendeleev literally dreamed up the periodic table of elements If you aren t making time for sleep you are limiting your creativity and your life s potential All cells need energy to live whether they are muscle cells in a hiker s leg or young yeast cells turning a tank of grape juice into wine Regardless of type however no cell can make energy Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can merely be transformed from one state to another Each cell must therefore obtain its energy from some outside environmental source and cells do so in a range of ways Yeast cells growing on a grape skin obtain energy from nutrient molecules originally processed within the grape leaves and stored within the fruit Humans obtain energy from molecules present in the plant and animal matter they eat and digest I believe mystery plays a fundamental role in experiencing the great things in life If you can determine the chemicals that exist in a food or wine does that help you understand why you like the taste Do you think that being able to list all the reasons you love a person enables you to love that person more or differently If something is beautiful to you can you really explain why in a meaningful way There are many sensations and feelings that we can experience but not fully define Once we give up the belief that definition of these emotions is necessary or possible we can actually experience them more completely because we have removed the analytical filter we use to find definitions Hunting for food has always been part of human life worldwide Since the dawn of human history people living in the rain forests have hunted for bushmeat For thousands of years they have lived in harmony with their forest world Today however the commercial bushmeat trade worldwide has become so large that many animals are literally on the edge of extinction Indeed if the bushmeat trade of endangered species isn t stopped immediately some animals will soon be hunted out of existence Recently television news coverage assisted by the new satellite technology began to bring instant news into our living rooms The immediacy and intimacy of the media have somehow allowed the events and persons of so called fame to precede those of worthiness Before the introduction of the new technology thoughtful objectivity and measured delivery had been most trusted The emphasis in news began to shift away from analysis and toward action The prize for broadcast journalism often seems to be going to the first as opposed to the best coverage Now watching the news we often find ourselves abandoned It is time to think seriously about the true value of news coverage Chocolate cake and candies are full of sugar and one day it may power your car Sugar is already the fuel for millions of Brazilian drivers How is this possible When sugar is fermented it produces alcohol Alcohol is mixed with gasoline creating a cleaner burning fuel Investors are betting big on alternative fuels derived from sugar and other crops Sugar producing countries such as Brazil and Thailand have invested heavily in alcohol projects to increase their production of the alternative energy With oil prices high alternative fuels are becoming a more realistic option as well as one that can offer environmental benefits When scientists use a device called a calorimeter the piece of food to be measured is placed inside the device sealed and then burned The energy from the food heats the water surrounding the chamber By weighing the amount of water heated noting the increase in the water temperature and multiplying the two the energy capacity of the food can be measured For example if liters of water surrounding the chamber is degrees centigrade before combustion and then is measured at degrees after combustion the difference in temperature degrees is multiplied by the volume of water liters to arrive at the caloric value calories of energy I was thrilled when your establishment moved into our neighborhood I appreciate the convenience that your family run business provides Your store is always clean and well stocked and your workers are always attentive and knowledgeable But I would like to bring one consideration to your attention and that is the cost of your merchandise I realize that a family run business will be more expensive than a chain store and I ve been willing to pay that difference Frequently however your prices are nearly double what I would have paid at other stores I want to continue shopping at your store but I m not sure I can consistently afford to pay such high prices For most of the world s plant life the effects of climate change over the past two decades have been productive according to an analysis of climate and satellite data collected between and The research addresses the question of how global vegetation has responded to changes in rainfall temperature and cloud cover patterns Such climate factors determine how vegetation grows Previous studies have looked at vegetation s response to climate change at regional scales but this is the first study to look at it from a global perspective According to the analysis global climate change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe allowing vegetation to increase by six percent over the study period Golf is probably one of the world s most popular sports Building new golf courses is the fastest kind of land development in the world An average person walks by a golf course and says to himself or herself What a lovely place Golf courses have beautiful grass lots of green plants and pretty ponds There are birds in the trees and flowers around the clubhouse The area is quiet and it seems peaceful This picture of a positive environment however is not real Golf course developers take over good farmland destroy the natural habitats of wild animals and pollute the water and the air If you are the sort of parent who frowns when you hear the word messy then relax No one is suggesting that you spread mud or baked beans all over the walls of your home Messy play can quite easily be contained in one part of a room With plenty of newspaper trash bags and aprons any untidiness can be cleaned up in no time Messy play at home will help your child develop his creative skills as he experiments with different materials and textures and learns about colors by mixing paints together And don t worry too much about clearing up afterwards The benefits of messy play far outweigh the disadvantages of a few spots of paint or mud It is all too easy to assume that everything in life is going to work out perfectly Some people plan their entire lives for years assuming that things will happen exactly as they hope For example some college students begin planning at the beginning of their freshman year what classes they will be taking through graduate school and then where they will end up working The problem is once they fail one class or have a bad experience that leads them to doubt their major all of these plans fall apart In general we should plan the future based on what we expect to happen Unfortunately things do not always work out as we want so we must be prepared for anything During the last several decades Asia s glaciers have been melting at an alarming rate According to Chinese researcher Yao Tandong annual glacial runoff on the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas is roughly percent more than that of years ago Some of that water is flowing into Asia s rivers increasing floods and spreading waterborne diseases In time the problem will reverse Yao predicts that percent of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau will be gone by the end of the century Once the rivers decrease and finally disappear oases will dry up and there will be no more cities We all make mistakes have to deal with challenging colleagues and face situations we are trying to turn around At times it s so overwhelming that you have no understanding of the situation Small pains seem monumental and important things get pushed aside as if they were insignificant It s not just that you can t see the forest for the trees you re stuck down there covered with leaves Here s what to do Rise above it Rise so far above it that you feel feet off the ground Then you will have the insight you need to sort it all out You will see what really matters in life If you have ever been near a sparking electric motor or a copying machine or been in a severe lightning storm you probably have smelled ozone Its odor is unmistakable but hard to describe Ozone is oxygen that has undergone rearrangement from the normal diatomic molecule O to a triatomic form O A simple chemical equation summarizes the reaction O Energy O Energy must be added for this reaction to occur which accounts for the fact that ozone forms when oxygen is subjected to electrical discharge whether from an electric spark or lightning Role theory takes the view that consumer behavior resembles actions in a play As people act out different roles they sometimes alter their consumption decisions depending on the play they are in The criteria that they use to evaluate products and services in one of their roles may be quite different from those used in another role In many cases the purchaser and the user of a product might not be the same person as when a parent picks out clothes for a teenager In other cases another person may act as an influencer providing recommendations for or against certain products without actually buying or using Some mental processes do slow down a bit in the course of aging But in terms of learning new skills and information older people are at no disadvantage A recent study shows that aging does not affect the amount of material you can absorb in a given period And once you ve learned it you ll probably retain it as well as a younger person The better educated you are and the more you continue to learn new things the greater the likelihood you ll maintain high cognitive functioning Many people want assurance that what is feared will not happen Unfortunately the need for a guarantee is strengthened by several forces in our relatively safe and comfortable modern world Movies and television programs confirm the illusion that all problems can be easily solved and that life should be safe and wonderful We don t like to face the truth that uncertainty is a part of life The tendency to look for someone to blame when something goes wrong implies that accidents should not occur We demand that our medicine transportation food and everything else be safe This is impossible Imagine the average workplace of a place without calculators computers or even electricity in many places When people in the future look back on what tool will they marvel that we functioned without What devices will become commonplace that nobody has yet imagined People capable of dealing with the future and the changes it holds are those who do not fear change and who practice flexibility Your job will not be the same in twenty years It just means you need to embrace innovation otherwise you will not stay on top Our success has come to be measured by what we do and what we earn and we work even harder and longer to sustain lifestyles that are well above world standards In recent years however an increasing number of Australians have concluded the pursuit of the dollar has been at the expense of happiness and well being and have chosen to cut their working hours and income This has been named downshifting This decade nearly a quarter of Australians aged to have downshifted To downshifters it is a fair balance between income and free time that they try to achieve Today I went into a bookstore to buy books for my wife Recognizing that I am a best selling writer some people asked me to sign books As I was writing in one of them I suddenly forgot how to spell controlled Does it have one l or two If I spell it wrong people will find out as soon as I leave But if I ask all these people will laugh at me At that moment I literally broke out in a sweat Thank you for coming to the interview on Friday afternoon for the assistant sales manager position I was enormously impressed by your professionalism enthusiasm and commitment to your work I knew the decision I would have to make would be difficult and it has been However I have made that decision and I am afraid that I cannot offer you the position at this time I do hope that you will keep in touch with the personnel department manager and that you will apply again next time The company plans to employ a large number of persons for the sales department next year Thank you again for your interest in the Hankook Corporation Flood waters are dangerous The force of a few inches of water can toss you to the ground While camping just keep your radio turned on and tuned to a weather station Tons of water miles away can reach and swallow you in a few minutes If there s a flood just get out of the car Cars can be easily swept away in just two feet of water If you have limited time take only family medicines blankets and a battery powered radio with you Don t wait until the last minute to leave hoping to save your possessions Save your life instead As far back as I can remember I ve heard about the importance of a positive attitude and the powerful effect it could have on my life I heard it from my parents teachers coaches and supervisors over the years How many times in your life have you been encouraged to have a positive attitude Although attitude plays an important role in everyone s life many people don t realize the influence it has on their performance at work and on their relationships The attitude that you carry around makes an incredible difference in your life It can be a powerful tool for positive action Or it can be a poison that weakens your ability to fulfill your potential Your attitude dictates whether you are living life or life is living you Attitude determines whether you are on the way or in the way Social scientists have long noted the relationship between lifelong education and income Put simply individuals who have invested in further education and in service training earn more money than individuals who have not Human capital consists of the skills and knowledge that an individual uses to produce goods and services Human capital is developed by investing time money and energy in the acquisition of new skills that enable us to be more productive By continuously investing in ourselves we expect to become more productive and to gain a higher income greater job satisfaction and better professional opportunities Perhaps the outstanding characteristic of my nine year old child is the fact that he is emerging from a long strong preoccupation with his mother Whereas at eight he could admit the presence of Mother now he often seems to resent her presence and her demands At eight he counted on his mother Or he was related strongly and warmly to his mother This nine year old child isn t willing to ask others for help In addition he is eager to achieve something for himself He has become a self starter and once started wishes to continue in his own way at his own time in his own direction Markets enable buyers and sellers to exchange goods and services A market may be a place where buyers put their money down and carry away whatever it is they have bought groceries from a supermarket for example But a market does not have to be a place It can be something more abstract Take the real estate market for example It is not possible to go and look at the real estate market instead the real estate market is a complicated set of arrangements involving real estate sales offices web pages and even information exchanged by neighbors talking over back fences Whether concrete or abstract markets help people exchange goods and services Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo were thrilled to see the first men walk on the moon and return to the earth Words such as fantastic and incredible were inadequate to describe those eventful days But to go there those astronauts had to break out of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth More energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift off or in the first few miles of travel than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles Habits too have tremendous gravity pull more than most people realize or would admit Breaking deeply rooted old habitual tendencies such as hesitance impatience selfishness and criticalness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little will power and a few minor changes in our lives Achieving lift off takes a tremendous effort but once we break out of the gravity pull our freedom takes on a whole new world When we hear about wetlands such as swamps and bogs we are often reminded of unpleasant experiences we get swamped with homework and bogged down in math problems This makes it hard to realize the importance of wetlands Wetlands are important to many kinds of animals and plants that live there Some birds nest in wetlands and others use them for rest stops during flights Wetlands are important to people too People visit wetlands to fish take pictures and just listen to the sounds and enjoy being outdoors Wetlands also help us in other ways They control flooding by soaking up water like a sponge and then letting it out later on Nearly two thirds of the world s population live under night skies polluted by light In most heavily urbanized regions it no longer really gets dark because of street lamps security lights searchlights office lights and neon signs In a natural night sky someone looking at the heavens with the unaided eye should be able to see nearly stars and planets and the glow from the Milky Way our home galaxy But in large cities the number of visible stars has fallen to a few dozen This stunning drop has made it impossible to grow up being exposed to the natural beauty and inspiration of the night sky Chef Walter Potenza owns three thriving Italian restaurants on Rhode Island He believes that his success is the product of lifetime education When I opened my first restaurant all of a sudden my schooling and my knowledge came into play It made me an academic a person who explored the food business Walter says And the learning never stops he adds Every time you read a book you get ideas Then you introduce your ideas into your workplace You make more work for yourself but you make that work better Chefs are made not born Credit card misuse remains at an alarmingly high level It is a cause not only of personal tragedies but also of more serious social problems But how can we deal with this situation Whatever solution we choose it must focus on changing consumers spending habits for the better Up to now people have been encouraged to use credit cards for various reasons This was good for those who used their cards wisely but many have taken on large debts as a result Now is the time therefore to emphasize sensible individual credit card use Various financial support programs can be helpful in this but unless consumers spend within their means there can be no solution In recent years we ve been dreaming very different dreams The stuff of these dreams is fantasy swords and wizards knights and ladies The business of fantasy has become a multibillion dollar reality and science fiction is starting to feel old fashioned Our fascination with science fiction reflected a deep faith that technology would lead us to a cyber utopia with robot servants serving food But in fact a dark pessimistic attitude toward technology and the future is attracting more and more people And the evidence is the world s new concern with a nostalgic magical vision of the past swords not lasers magic not electricity villages not cities the past not the future Every human being will grow older and die Aging in itself is not a disease or a sickness but as people age disease often follows and the elderly need others help In addition the percentage of senior citizens in the world has increased very quickly and our society is no exception The problem for us is that we have left the care of the elderly to their families We must change our attitude toward this issue and develop more systematic social programs The sooner we realize the importance of the role of government in this matter the smaller the final cost to society as a whole will be Traditional fairy tales show heroines who are usually beautiful and passive and spend a lot of their time indoors cooking and cleaning Many authors today however are creating fairy stories in which the heroines are more active For example in Cinder Edna a modern version of Cinderella by Ellen B Jackson the heroine wears comfortable shoes and takes the bus to the party In Sleepless Beauty by Frances Minters Beauty instead of falling asleep fools the wicked witch by setting an alarm clock In other stories set in modern times more and more strong clever female characters are appearing Change happens to us all at some point in our life I am no exception When I was young I went through serious growing pains My ankles and knees ached at night It hurt and it was a little scary My mother told me that it had something to do with growth plates She explained that I should accept the aches and pains gladly because they meant that I was growing fast When other painful changes came along in later life I always recalled my mother s words And recently when a friend of mine was having a hard time dealing with the loss of his job I gave him the same advice At first he couldn t accept it but after a while he came to see that this was one of the changes that happen to everyone In the end losing a job motivated him to start his own business These experiences have taught me that change which is an essential part of our life can have both positive and negative effects It may hurt us a little when it occurs but if we accept it as a growth process it will bring benefits in the long run My best advice is to go with the flow Keep an open mind and be optimistic  Researchers in psychology follow the scientific method to perform studies that help explain and may predict human behavior This is a much more challenging task than studying snails or sound waves It often requires compromises such as testing behavior within laboratories rather than natural settings and asking those readily available such as introduction to psychology students to participate rather than collecting data from a true cross section of the population It often requires great cleverness to conceive of measures that tap into what people are thinking without altering their thinking called reactivity Simply knowing they are being observed may cause people to behave differently such as more politely People may give answers that they feel are more socially desirable than their true feelings But for all of these difficulties for psychology the payoff of the scientific method is that the findings are replicable that is if you run the same study again following the same procedures you will be very likely to get the same results Clearly schematic knowledge helps you guiding your understanding and enabling you to reconstruct things you cannot remember But schematic knowledge can also hurt you promoting errors in perception and memory Moreover the types of errors produced by schemata are quite predictable Bear in mind that schemata summarize the broad pattern of your experience and so they tell you in essence what s typical or ordinary in a given situation Any reliance on schematic knowledge therefore will be shaped by this information about what s normal Thus if there are things you don t notice while viewing a situation or event your schemata will lead you to fill in these gaps with knowledge about what s normally in place in that setting Likewise if there are things you can t recall your schemata will fill in the gaps with knowledge about what s typical in that situation As a result a reliance on schemata will inevitably make the world seem more normal than it really is and will make the past seem more regular than it actually was Olivia and her sister Ellie were standing with Grandma in the middle of the cabbages Suddenly Grandma asked Do you know what a Cabbage White is Yes I learned about it in biology class It s a beautiful white butterfly Olivia answered Right But it lays its eggs on cabbages and then the caterpillars eat the cabbage leaves So why don t you help me to pick the caterpillars up Grandma suggested The two sisters gladly agreed and went back to the house to get ready Soon armed with a small bucket each Olivia and Ellie went back to Grandma When they saw the cabbage patch they suddenly remembered how vast it was There seemed to be a million cabbages Olivia stood open mouthed at the sight of the endless cabbage field She thought they could not possibly pick all of the caterpillars off Olivia sighed in despair Grandma smiled at her and said Don t worry We are only working on this first row here today Relieved she and Ellie started on the first cabbage The caterpillars wriggled as they were picked up while Cabbage Whites filled the air around them It was as if the butterflies were making fun of Olivia they seemed to be laughing at her suggesting that they would lay millions more eggs The cabbage patch looked like a battlefield Olivia felt like she was losing the battle but she fought on She kept filling her bucket with the caterpillars until the bottom disappeared Feeling exhausted and discouraged she asked Grandma Why don t we just get rid of all the butterflies so that there will be no more eggs or caterpillars Grandma smiled gently and said Why wrestle with Mother Nature The butterflies help us grow some other plants because they carry pollen from flower to flower Olivia realized she was right Grandma added that although she knew caterpillars did harm to cabbages she didn t wish to disturb the natural balance of the environment Olivia now saw the butterflies true beauty Olivia and Ellie looked at their full buckets and smiled The printing press boosted the power of ideas to copy themselves Prior to low cost printing ideas could and did spread by word of mouth While this was tremendously powerful it limited the complexity of the ideas that could be propagated to those that a single person could remember It also added a certain amount of guaranteed error The spread of ideas by word of mouth was equivalent to a game of telephone on a global scale The advent of literacy and the creation of handwritten scrolls and eventually handwritten books strengthened the ability of large and complex ideas to spread with high fidelity But the incredible amount of time required to copy a scroll or book by hand limited the speed with which information could spread this way A well trained monk could transcribe around four pages of text per day A printing press could copy information thousands of times faster allowing knowledge to spread far more quickly with full fidelity than ever before A major challenge for map makers is the depiction of hills and valleys slopes and flatlands collectively called the topography This can be done in various ways One is to create an image of sunlight and shadow so that wrinkles of the topography are alternately lit and shaded creating a visual representation of the shape of the land Another technically more accurate way is to draw contour lines A contour line connects all points that lie at the same elevation A round hill rising above a plain therefore would appear on the map as a set of concentric circles the largest at the base and the smallest near the top When the contour lines are positioned closely together the hill s slope is steep if they lie farther apart the slope is gentler Contour lines can represent scarps hollows and valleys of the local topography At a glance they reveal whether the relief in the mapped area is great or small a busy contour map means lots of high relief Most consumer magazines depend on subscriptions and advertising Subscriptions account for almost percent of total magazine circulation Single copy or newsstand sales account for the rest However single copy sales are important they bring in more revenue per magazine because subscription prices are typically at least percent less than the price of buying single issues Further potential readers explore a new magazine by buying a single issue all those insert cards with subscription offers are included in magazines to encourage you to subscribe Some magazines are distributed only by subscription Professional or trade magazines are specialized magazines and are often published by professional associations They usually feature highly targeted advertising For example the Columbia Journalism Review is marketed toward professional journalists and its few advertisements are news organizations book publishers and others A few magazines like Consumer Reports work toward objectivity and therefore contain no advertising To modern man disease is a biological phenomenon that concerns him only as an individual and has no moral implications When he contracts influenza he never attributes this event to his behavior toward the tax collector or his mother in law Among primitives because of their supernaturalistic theories the prevailing moral point of view gives a deeper meaning to disease The gods who send disease are usually angered by the moral offences of the individual Sometimes they may not strike the guilty person himself but rather one of his relatives or tribesmen to whom responsibility is extended Disease action that might produce disease and recovery from disease are therefore of vital concern to the whole primitive community Disease as a sanction against social misbehavior becomes one of the most important pillars of order in such societies It takes over in many cases the role played by policemen judges and priests in modern society Both humans and rats have evolved taste preferences for sweet foods which provide rich sources of calories A study of food preferences among the Hadza hunter gatherers of Tanzania found that honey was the most highly preferred food item an item that has the highest caloric value Human newborn infants also show a strong preference for sweet liquids Both humans and rats dislike bitter and sour foods which tend to contain toxins They also adaptively adjust their eating behavior in response to deficits in water calories and salt Experiments show that rats display an immediate liking for salt the first time they experience a salt deficiency They likewise increase their intake of sweets and water when their energy and fluids become depleted These appear to be specific evolved mechanisms designed to deal with the adaptive problem of food selection and coordinate consumption patterns with physical needs An incident in Japan in the s alerted the world to the potential problems of organic mercury in fish Factories were discharging mercury into the waters of Minamata Bay which also harbored a commercial fishing industry Mercury was being bioaccumulated in the fish tissue and severe mercury poisoning occurred in many people who consumed the fish The disabling neurological symptoms were subsequently called Minamata disease Control over direct discharge of mercury from industrial operations is clearly needed for prevention However it is now recognized that traces of mercury can appear in lakes far removed from any such industrial discharge It is postulated that such contamination may result from airborne transport from remote power plants or municipal incinerators Strictly controlled emission standards for such sources are needed to minimize this problem Fish advisories have been issued for many lakes in the United States these recommend limits on the number of times per month particular species of fish should be consumed In one sense every character you create will be yourself You ve never murdered but your murderer s rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade even though the circumstances are totally different and you re not even consciously thinking about your middle school years Our characters emotions after all draw on our own emotions Sometimes however you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction dramatizing actual incidents Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself The problem with this and it is a very large problem is that almost no one can view himself objectively on the page A s the writer you re too close to your own complicated makeup It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you In fact that s what authors largely have done You can still of course incorporate aspects of yourself your love of Beethoven your quick temper your soccer injuries But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation by definition did not have It was the first day of the new semester Steve and Dave were excited that they would be back at school again They rode their bicycles to school together that morning as they usually did Dave had math on the first floor and Steve was on the second with history On his way to the classroom Steve s teacher came up to him to ask if he wanted to run for student president Steve thought for a moment and answered Sure it ll be a great experience After class Steve spotted Dave in the hallway and ran to him excitedly I ve got good news I m going for student president and I think mine will be the only nomination Dave cleared his throat and replied with surprise Actually I ve just registered my name too He continued sharply Well best of luck But don t think you ll win the election Steve Dave walked quickly away and from that moment on there was an uncomfortable air of tension between the two friends Steve tried to be friendly toward Dave but he just didn t seem to care When the election day came Steve found that his bicycle had a flat tire so he started to run to school Just as he reached the end of the street Dave s dad who was driving Dave to school pulled over to give him a ride The dead silence in the car made the drive painful Noticing the bad atmosphere Dave s dad said You know only one of you can win You have known each other since birth Don t let this election ruin your friendship Try to be happy for each other His words hit Dave hard Looking at Steve Dave felt the need to apologize to him later that day Steve won the election Upon hearing the result Dave went over to Steve and congratulated him shaking his hand Steve could still see the disappointment burning in his eyes It wasn t until later that evening on the way home that Dave said apologetically I m so sorry Steve This election hasn t damaged our friendship has it Of course not Dave We re friends as always Steve responded with a smile As Steve arrived home his dad was proudly waiting for him and said Congratulations on the win How did Dave take it Steve replied We re fine now best friends for life His dad laughed Sounds like you won two battles today Interestingly being observed has two quite distinct effects on performance In some cases performance is decreased even to the point of non existence The extreme of this is stage fright the sudden fear of public performance There are many instances of well known actors who in mid career develop stage fright and simply cannot perform The other extreme is that being observed enhances performance people doing whatever it might be better when they know that others are watching The general rule seems to be that if one is doing something new or for the first time then being observed while doing it decreases performance On the other hand being observed while doing some task or engaging in some activity that is well known or well practiced tends to enhance performance So if you are learning to play a new sport it is better to begin it alone but when you become skilled at it then you will probably perform better with an audience Evolution works to maximize the number of descendants that an animal leaves behind Where the risk of death from fishing increases as an animal grows evolution favors those that grow slowly mature younger and smaller and reproduce earlier This is exactly what we now see in the wild Cod in Canada s Gulf of St Lawrence begin to reproduce at around four today forty years ago they had to wait until six or seven to reach maturity Sole in the North Sea mature at half the body weight they did in Surely these adaptations are good news for species hard pressed by excessive fishing Not exactly Young fish produce many fewer eggs than large bodied animals and many industrial fisheries are now so intensive that few animals survive more than a couple of years beyond the age of maturity Together this means there are fewer eggs and larvae to secure future generations In some cases the amount of young produced today is a hundred or even a thousand times less than in the past putting the survival of species and the fisheries dependent on them at grave risk What is the best order for a report paper or other technical document Of course it must be logical but that means simply that the paper must have connection and sequence and a variety of orders is possible under this heading Too many writers interpret the term logical to mean chronological and it has become habitual to begin reports and papers with careful reviews of previous work Usually this is tactically weak Most readers of reports and papers are reading the documents because they are interested in and know something about the subject Therefore to rehearse to them the findings of previous work is simply to bore them with unnecessary reminders The interesting thing for them is the new information the new findings and conclusions So it is usually best to start with those pieces of information To give a long chronological account of work or procedures is normally appropriate only when the essential point of the paper is the chronological sequence I expect that global society will increase annual investments from today to of the GDP in Much of this investment will be in energy efficient goods that are more expensive than old fashioned stuff designed for an era of cheap energy Another share will be invested in the shift from coal to more expensive fuels like conventional gas Some will go into the construction of new renewable energy supply even during the years before it becomes competitive And a lot will go into repair of climate damage or adaptation to future climate damage for example investing in new protective walls along the coast to keep the rising ocean back These huge increases in investment would not come about if investment was left to the market Rather they will happen only through state intervention based on parliamentary decision It will be either direct when the government invests the tax dollars in whatever capacity it considers to be most necessary or indirect when the government passes legislation that makes the desired activity more profitable The impacts of tourism on the environment are evident to scientists but not all residents attribute environmental damage to tourism Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas improves the quality of the roads and public facilities and does not contribute to ecological decline Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems overcrowded outdoor recreation or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks Alternatively some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing hunting and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion Some studies suggest that variations in residents feelings about tourism s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions Duration refers to the time that events last If we think of tempo as the speed of events then duration is the speed of the clock itself For the physicist the duration of a second is precise and unambiguous it is equal to cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium In the realm of psychological experience however quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation When people are removed from the cues of real time be it the sun bodily fatigue or timepieces themselves it doesn t take long before their time sense breaks down And it is this usually imprecise psychological clock as opposed to the time on one s watch that creates the perception of duration that people experience Theoretically a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo Imagine for example that baseballs are pitched to two different batters The balls are thrown every seconds for seconds so a total of balls are thrown We now ask both batters how much time has passed Let s say that batter number one who loves hitting feels the duration to be seconds Batter number two bored by baseball believes it to be seconds Psychologically then the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds The perceived tempo in other words is faster for batter number one A seventeen year old German boy named Erik Brandes stepped out onto the empty vast stage of the Cologne Opera House It was the most exciting day of Erik s life The youngest concert promoter in Germany had persuaded the Opera House to host a late night concert of improvised jazz by the American pianist Keith Jarrett The concert was a sellout and later that evening Keith would sit down at the piano and play But when Erik introduced Keith and his producer Manfred to the piano on the stage that afternoon it didn t go well Keith and Manfred played a few notes Then after a long silence Manfred came to him and said Erik if you don t get another piano Keith can t play tonight Erik knew that Keith had requested a specific instrument which the Opera House had agreed to provide What he hadn t realized was that the administrative staff hadn t been able to find the requested B sendorfer piano and they had instead installed a tiny little B sendorfer that was in poor condition Understandably Keith didn t want to perform He left and went to wait in his car leaving Erik to anticipate the arrival of soon to be furious concert goers Desperate the German teenager caught up with Keith and begged the jazz pianist to play The pianist looked out at him standing in the rain completely soaked and took pity on him Never forget Keith said Only for you A few hours later Keith walked out to the unplayable piano in front of a packed concert hall When Keith began to play everybody immediately knew this was magic Erik too was deeply touched Keith was unexpectedly producing the performance of a lifetime despite the shortcomings of the piano His left hand produced thundering repetitive bass riffs as a way of covering up the piano s lack of resonance Keith really had to play that piano very hard to get enough volume to get to the balconies Standing up and sitting down Keith played the unplayable piano to produce something unique It wasn t the music that he ever imagined playing But faced with a challenge he accepted it and flew high Some people make few intentional changes in life Sure over time they may get fatter gather lines and go gray But they wear their hair the same way buy the same brand of shoes eat the same breakfast and stick to routines for no reason other than the ease of a comfortable predictable life Yet as both research and real life show many others do make important changes They train for marathons quit smoking switch fields write plays take up the guitar or learn to tango even if they never danced before in their lives What is the difference between these two groups of people It s their perspective People who change do not question whether change is possible or look for reasons they cannot change They simply decide on a change they want and do what is necessary to accomplish it Changing which always stems from a firm decision becomes job number one Sometimes after punishment has been administered a few times it needn t be continued because the mere threat of punishment is enough to induce the desired behavior Psychologists call this avoidance training because the person is learning to avoid the possibility of a punishing consequence Avoidance training is responsible for many everyday behaviors It has taught you to carry an umbrella when it looks like rain to avoid the punishment of getting wet and to keep your hand away from a hot iron to avoid the punishment of a burn Avoidance training however doesn t always work in our favor For instance a child who has been repeatedly criticized for poor performance on math may learn to dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further punishment Unfortunately because of this avoidance the child fails to develop his math skills and therefore improve the capabilities he has and so a vicious cycle has set in The avoidance must be unlearned through some positive experiences with math in order for this cycle to be broken Remember when you were little and you imagined that adults had infinite power Surely someone who could drive the car open the juice container and reach the sink could make it stop raining I think that s the same expectation that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to smell Because they are so good at using their noses we assume that they can smell anything anytime But dogs use other senses too and the brains of both humans and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time Many owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing into the house these dogs were using their eyes instead of their noses Their noses may be remarkable but they re not always switched on Money beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and shelter is nothing more than a means to an end Yet so often we confuse means with ends and sacrifice happiness end for money means It is easy to do this when material wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end as it so often is in our society This is not to say that the accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself wrong Material prosperity can help individuals as well as society attain higher levels of happiness Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful and from having to worry about the next paycheck Moreover the desire to make money can challenge and inspire us Even so it is not the money per se that is valuable but the fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth Food intake is essential for the survival of every living organism The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can have deadly consequences Therefore it is not surprising that humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality A first judgment about the value of a food source is made on its appearance and smell Food that looks and smells attractive is taken into the mouth Here based on a complex sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste but also includes smell touch and hearing the final decision whether to swallow or reject food is made Frequently this complex interaction between different senses is inappropriately referred to as taste although it should be better called flavor perception because it uses multiple senses Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control There can be broad influential factors sometimes of an economic nature that hold down the performance of everyone being judged One example is in sales If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year sales could be down for example by an average of This actually figure would then represent average performance Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a drop in sales over the previous year Thus good performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use Of course the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge In the middle of the th century Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were He answered Madam what good is a baby Of course Faraday s experiments were the beginning of the electronic age Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world transistors vaccines plastics began as basic research Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional Science is the study of nature and as we learn more about how nature works we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us The seemingly resourceful knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature Science tells us where we are and what we are and that knowledge is beyond value The midday sun was glorious The high school grounds were filled with well dressed people posing in fancy dresses and suits for cheerful photographers Congratulations hugs and laughter were contagious Hannah looked at all the familiar faces that had been part of her life for the last few years Soon her mother would be joining them She recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that same place in the middle of many anxious freshmen some of whom had become her closest friends That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead Hannah was nervous and trembling The principal was energetically addressing them talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life but she could not concentrate Later a tall strict looking man introduced himself as her homeroom teacher The classroom was old but neat and inviting Hannah was seated in the fifth row hallway side even though she had wanted a window seat High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted Hannah struggled with the many class hours the endless assignments and the exams However there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals How could she ever forget her second year She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival part of a sensational performance After that she had become more confident and active Her thoughts wandering Hannah vaguely heard her mother s voice Here you are Her mother hurried over and gave her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug Hannah you look so serious What are you thinking about Oh Mom just you know Her mother smiled You ll miss this place won t you Hannah nodded Quick her mother said stand over there and smile Hannah You have such a pretty smile She hurried out her cell phone zoomed in on her daughter and realized suddenly that she was looking at a young lady You re all grown up she whispered Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever The impact of color has been studied for decades For example in a factory the temperature was maintained at and the walls were painted a cool blue green The employees complained of the cold The temperature was maintained at the same level but the walls were painted a warm coral The employees stopped complaining about the temperature and reported they were quite comfortable The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame football team The locker rooms used for half time breaks were reportedly painted to take advantage of the emotional impact of certain hues The home team room was painted a bright red which kept team members excited or even angered The visiting team room was painted a blue green which had a calming effect on the team members The success of this application of color can be noted in the records set by Notre Dame football teams Food plays a large part in how much you enjoy the outdoors The possibilities are endless so you can constantly vary your diet Wilderness dining has two extremes gourmet eaters and survival eaters The first like to make camp at lunchtime so they have several hours to set up field ovens they bake cakes and bread and cook multi course dinners They walk only a few miles each day and may use the same campsite for several nights Survival eaters eat some dry cereal for breakfast and are up and walking within minutes of waking They walk dozens of miles every day lunch is a series of cold snacks eaten on the move Dinner consists of a freeze dried meal cooked by pouring hot water into the package Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued researchers and it has always been assumed that the insects must rely on an internal clock Recently however one group of scientists working with the year cicada in California have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that they can count For their experiments they took year old nymphs and moved them to an experimental enclosure These nymphs should have taken a further two years to emerge as adults but in fact they took just one year The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots the insects fed were exposed By doing this the trees were tricked into flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on So it seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the peaks Some years ago a psychologist named Richard Lippa called a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like extroverts while pretending to teach a math class Then he and his team with video cameras in hand measured the length of their strides the amount of eye contact they made with their students the percentage of time they spent talking and the volume of their speech They also rated how generally extroverted those fake extroverts appeared based on their recorded voices and body language Then Lippa did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the results He found that although the latter group came across as more extroverted some of the fake extroverts were surprisingly convincing It seems that most of us know how to fake it to some extent Whether or not we re aware that the length of our strides and the amount of time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and extroverts we know it unconsciously Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly established that certain works have certain effects Plato is sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us cowardly the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress such representations Tolstoy is confident that the artist who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those feelings on to us we can no more escape than we could escape an infectious disease In fact however the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes Some people may indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of working out those fantasies in real life Others may be disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence Still others may be left unmoved neither attracted nor disgusted Increased size affects group life in a number of ways There is evidence that larger groups five or six members are more productive than smaller groups two or three members Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups and although they seem to reach less agreement they also show less tension These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal directed since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform In such groups it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result Groups with an even number of members may split into halves This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members one side always has a numerical advantage According to some researchers the number five has special significance Groups of this size usually escape the problems we have just outlined Moreover they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction because of the odd number of members deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur In my office I have a framed letterfrom a couple of children I have never met The letter holds a special significance for me It reads Dear Dr Brown thanks for teaching Mr Wills to teach Tisha and Kelly Mr Wills is Jeremy Wills and he is one of my former students A few years back he took my positive psychology class in college After graduation Jeremy joined an organization that recruits future leaders to teach in low income communities He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county in North Carolina Later his assistant principal took note of Jeremy s high expectations and asked him to take over his math class He took charge of about a dozen failing special ed kids and Tisha and Kelly were among them His idealism ran high and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems Before long the reality hit Jeremy hard Even after spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans it became clear that his methods were not working One of the worst moments was when he distributed a math test Many students didn t even look at the exam They just put their heads on their desks and slept Jeremy became so stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom Jeremy knew something had to change e He then thought back to my class remembering how negative emotions can drag you down leaving positive emotions unnoticed That s when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students As the students attitudes became more optimistic their confidence with math grew too At the end of the school year percent of Jeremy s students passed the state s math test B We tend to perceive the door of a classroom as rectangular no matter from which angle it is viewed Actually the rectangular door of a classroom projects a rectangular image on our retina only when it is viewed directly from the front At other angles the image will be seen as a trapezoid The edge of the door towards us looks wider than the edge hinged with the frame Slowly the trapezoid becomes thinner and thinner and all that is projected on the retina is a vertical line which is the thickness of the door These changes we can observe and distinguish but we do not accept them Similarly a round coin is seen as round even when viewed from an angle at which objectively it should appear elliptical In the same way we see car wheels as round even though the retinal image is oval when viewed from an angle other than directly from the front It s important that the media provide us with diverse and opposing views so we can choose the best available options Let s take the example of going to war War should be a last resort obviously undertaken when all other options have failed So when someone is threatening to go to war or trying to convince us and mounting a huge public relations campaign to justify it the news media have a responsibility to question everything They should be providing the most intense scrutiny on our behalf so the public can see the other side of things Otherwise we may be drawn into unnecessary wars or wars fought for reasons other than those presented by governments and generals Most of the time the media fail to perform this crucial role Even the large so called liberal American media have admitted that they have not always been watchdogs for the public interest and that their own coverage on some major issues looks strikingly one sided at times Low balling describes the technique where two individuals arrive at an agreement and then one increases the cost to be incurred by the other For example after the consumer has agreed to purchase a car for the salesperson begins to add on for tax and for tires These additional costs might be thought of as a metaphorical low ball that the salesperson throws the consumer One explanation for the effectiveness of low balling is in terms of self perception theory When the consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original terms that behavior might be used by the consumer to infer his sincere interest in the product This inferred sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure the increased cost An alternative explanation is in terms of impression management theory If the consumer were to withdraw from the deal after the slight change in the terms of agreement he might foster the rather undesirable impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of these necessary charges There is a difference between getting what you want and getting what you think you want Technology gives us more and more of what we think we want These days looking at sociable robots and digitized friends one might assume that what we want is to be always in touch and never alone no matter who or what we are in touch with One might assume that what we want is plenty of weak ties the informal networks that underpin online acquaintanceship But if we pay attention to the real consequences of what we think we want we may discover what we really want We may want some stillness and solitude As an American writer once put it we may want to live less thickly and wait for more infrequent but meaningful face to face encounters As we put in our many hours of typing with all fingers or just thumbs we may discover that we miss the human voice We may decide that it is fine to play chess with a robot but that robots are unfit for any conversation about family or friends A robot might have needs but to understand desire one needs language and flesh We may decide that for these conversations we must have a person who knows firsthand what it means to be born to have parents and a family to wish for love and perhaps children and to anticipate death And of course we must not let the virtual take us away from the real world that doesn t go away with a power outage How much space do you need to be happy Part of the American story is that bigger is better and with cheap credit and tax breaks for home buyers it s tempting to stretch one s finances to build or buy a larger house My grandpa Otto chose a different path He didn t want to find himself working longer and longer hours just to pay for more space and the stuff to fill it He grew up in a farming community and within a very large family so living simply was integral to his life philosophy In the s when my dad was a little boy my grandpa built a square foot cottage He put the twenty bythirty foot structure on a small plot of land in Pleasant Hill Dad remarked Reusing and recycling was a necessity In essence he was recycling before it became cool Grandpa got most of the materials for his little house from the Oakland docks where he was working It took four years to build the small cottage and when they moved in the roof wasn t even on My dad recalled looking up at the stars in the roofless house as a twelve year old kid before falling asleep Dad didn t mind living in an unfinished house He described Pleasant Hill as open and private It felt like all the homes were on ten acres Over the years my dad and grandpa noticed dramatic changes in their community Each year more farmland was devoured to build strip malls and neighborhoods with larger homes As real estate prices rose many of their neighbors sold their homes and lots Soon my grandpa had the only small house on the block surrounded by a sea of homes four times the size of his dwelling Yet my grandpa loved his little home and was content with what he had Even though the house was small it didn t feel cramped As my dad said Everyone was happy and content The size of the house didn t matter My grandpa taught me that living a simple life isn t about self deprivation Instead it s about giving yourself the time freedom and money to pursue your dreams In many ways I ve modeled my life after that of my grandpa I learned from him that simplicity isn t about austerity It s a revolution in personal growth A You have probably heard about sending messages across the sea in bottles The problem is it is impossible to tell how long it will take the sea to deliver its bottled messages or where it will wash them up In Christopher Columbus sent one of the earliest and most famous bottled messages He was returning to Spain to tell the king and queen about what he had discovered when his ship got caught in a bad storm Columbus was still more than a thousand miles from Europe and he feared he would never live to tell the king and queen of his discovery So he wrote the news on a piece of paper He put it in a wooden bottle and tossed it overboard More than years later it was found by the captain of an American ship off the coast of Africa near Morocco Life can be like riding a roller coaster There are ups and downs fast and slow parts bumps and shaky parts and even times when you re upside down You can t control which way the track or in this case life events will take you When you re at the bottom you can see only what s right in front of you but when you get to the top you can see the whole picture a lot better When you re starting out accept how you feel and try to enjoy the ride When it s over you ll see that it was really cool even if you couldn t see that when you first started As Tom was waiting for a bus he noticed a blind man trying to cross the street The traffic was heavy and it was likely the blind man would get hit as he was not crossing at a crosswalk Tom looked around and saw there was no one else to help so he asked the blind man if he would like help crossing the street The blind man readily said yes then latched onto Tom s arm and they began their walk across the street avoiding speeding cars When Tom had helped the blind man to cross the street he realized he had left his book bag on the bus stop bench When Tom looked back at the bus stop bench he saw another man sitting next to his book bag And when Tom got to the bus stop bench the man said I saw what you were doing so I decided to sit here and watch your book bag It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others It is not just the size of the park that matters Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences and players know this So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one say percent better One analysis found that the player hit percent more home runs Why The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is If you think you are likely to hit more home runs you are more likely to swing for the fences But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base In business and life just as in baseball our perceptions can affect whether we swing for the fences or not The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be Consider your work and your current life Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier Mom once said that my grandmother came to America as a poor uneducated Greek immigrant at eighteen My grandmother wanted to go to school but the harsh immigrant life pushed her to support her family Though she never learned to read in school she knew many traditional stories from her home country My grandmother liked to tell me these interesting stories at night I still remember a few stories in which the gods made promises with each other like humans Those who broke their promises were punished While listening to the stories I decided that I would not break any promises The morals of her stories taught me how I should live my life One day when I saw my grandmother on the street by chance I noticed that she had difficulty in reading an English sign Right at that moment it hit upon me to teach her to read English in return for all she had taught me I talked to my mom about it and she was delighted with my plan So my grandmother and I worked hard together using books for beginners My efforts were rewarded only a month later on the morning of my eighteenth birthday My grandmother decorated a cake with HAPPY BIRTHDAY BETTY I had only taught her the basics of reading but she had written these words all by herself Touched by this simple message I said It s not just my birthday Grandma You stepped into this country at eighteen Now you are stepping into another new world So it s your birthday too Apologies often fail One reason apologies fail is that the offender and the victim usually see the event differently Examining personal narratives researchers have found that those who cause harm tend to minimize the offense probably to protect themselves from shame and guilt They also tend to downplay the consequences of their actions These tendencies can inflame the anger of the hurt person who in contrast may see an offense as bigger than it really is Those who are hurt tend to see the act as one with severe consequences and as part of an ongoing pattern that is inexcusable and immoral Each person has his or her own truth and there is distortion on both sides Therefore to apologize sincerely we must first listen attentively to how the other person really feels about what happened not simply assert what we think happened When you walk into a store you are besieged by information Even purchases that seem simple can quickly turn into a cognitive quagmire Look at the jam aisle A glance at the shelves can inspire a whole range of questions Should you buy the smooth textured strawberry jam or the one with less sugar Does the more expensive jam taste better Rational models of decision making suggest that the way to find the best product is to take all of this information into account and to carefully analyze the different brands on display But this method can backfire When we spend too much time thinking in the supermarket we can trick ourselves into choosing the wrong things for the wrong reasons Making better decisions when picking out jams or bottles of wine is best done with the emotional brain which generates its verdict automatically Once upon a time there was only one way to launch a hit album radio Nothing else reached as many people as often Getting on a radio playlist was difficult but once a song was in heavy rotation on the radio it had a high probability of selling Then in the s came MTV which became the second way to create a hit It had even more limited capacity for new music but its influence over a generation was unparalleled For the music labels those were good times it was a brutally competitive business but it was a business they knew They understood the rules and they could earn their keep by working them But now rock radio is in seemingly terminal decline and MTV doesn t show many music videos anymore So how to market music Labels know the answer lies online tapping the word of mouth forces that are replacing traditional marketing in creating demand but they re still trying to figure out exactly how best to do it Research has shown that we automatically assign to good looking individuals such favorable traits as talent kindness honesty and intelligence Furthermore we make these judgements without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process Some consequences of this unconscious assumption that good looking equals good scare me For example a study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians follow up research demonstrated that voters did not realize their bias In fact percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance only percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence Voters can deny the impact of attractiveness on electability all they want but evidence has continued to confirm its troubling presence Why in country after country that mandated seat belts was it impossible to see the promised reduction in road accident fatalities John Adams professor of geography at University College London wrote in one of his many essays on risk It appears that measures that protect drivers from the consequences of bad driving encourage bad driving The principal effect of seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of risk from those already best protected in cars to the most vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists outside cars Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings under the concept of risk compensation the idea that humans have an inborn tolerance for risk As safety features are added to vehicles and roads drivers feel less vulnerable and tend to take more chances The phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily lives Children who wear protective gear during their games have a tendency to take more physical risks Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can access them easily What should writers do when they re teased by intriguing but elusive ideas by hints of thoughts that seem too vague to be expressed in words Edgar Allan Poe s advice is simple They should pick up their pens or he might add today power up their laptops Poe dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or subtle that they re beyond the compass of words For my own part he said in an article in Graham s Magazine I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it The mere act of writing Poe believed helps writers make their ideas not only clearer but more logical To use his phrase the process of writing contributes to the logicalization of thought Whenever he felt dissatisfied with a vague conception of the brain Poe said I resort forthwith to the pen for the purpose of obtaining through its aid the necessary form consequence and precision Today s advocates of freewriting would probably agree with Poe on this point Sometimes the best way to resolve a dilemma whether it s a writing dilemma or a thinking dilemma is simply to start writing On May th there was a heavy rain but the sun came out the next day Driving back from the village I stopped the car because a small woodchuck was traveling along the road its belly almost flat to the gravel I got out took off my sweater threw it over the woodchuck and wrapped him in it then put him on the floor of the car while I drove home I guessed the rain had washed out his burrow If I hadn t come along he would have eventually died of starvation Rescuing him I felt as large as Fate At home I put him in the bathtub and my husband found a large carton He put cat litter in the bottom and straw on top of that When I put the chuck in he gratefully burrowed into the straw I made a mixture of milk and baby cereal for him When I gave it to the chuck he ate it greedily He accepted me quickly If I put my hand in the carton he nibbled my fingers It became clear that I was imprinting the woodchuck and vice versa Very shortly the carton seemed too small I offered him a nest made of a covered box bedded with straw and with a round doorway cut in the front He knew instantly that a hole spells home and he dashed inside Every time I came to feed him he jumped into my lap as eagerly as ever As the months passed the chuck grew bigger and bigger My husband remarked that if I didn t do something soon I would be chased around for the rest of my days by a pound woodchuck begging for milk I decided to put him in a new burrow I found a hole along the wall of our orchard put the chuck near it and left him I continued to visit him with his milk Each time he greeted me joyfully drank greedily and tried persistently to follow me back into the house The parting came unexpectedly I went away on a brief trip When I came back I saw no sign of him In the spring when I see a large handsome woodchuck playing on the grass I will hope that it is he Do you worry about losing your good health Do you fear that crime war or terrorist attacks will disrupt the economy and your security These are legitimate concerns that many people share We live in difficult and uncertain times But are these fears real Research shows that people who watch a lot of news on television overestimate the threats to their well being Why It s because television focuses on news that makes the world seem like a more dangerous place than it actually is Afraid of the world that is portrayed on TV people stay in their homes with close family and do not build bonds with their neighbors Thus they become more vulnerable Surrounding ourselves with a wall of fear however is not the answer The only way to overcome this problem is to be more connected to others and this connection will reduce fear and isolation Sperm whales travel in social groups that cooperate to defend and protect each other and may even share suckling of calves It is difficult to determine the membership of these groups from sightings alone because of the practical difficulties of observing whale behavior most of which happens underwater To make things even more difficult sperm whales can travel across entire oceans and can dive to a depth of a kilometer Biologists who study whale behavior generally have to be content with hanging around in boats waiting for their subjects to surface But when they do surface in addition to taking photos which allow individual whales to be identified biologists can zip over in worryingly small boats and pick up the bits of skin that the whales leave behind on the surface when they re submerge The DNA extracted from these bits of whale skin not only identifies the individuals in the group but also reveals their relationships to each other This has allowed researchers to describe sperm whale social groups in detail Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties rather than taking up the case of one party against another At times particularly in very complex situations the processes of advocacy and mediation can overlap perhaps with very problematic results as one loses clarity over his or her role It is therefore important if not essential to maintain a clear focus in undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure that the roles do not become blurred and therefore potentially counterproductive For example a mediator who takes sides is likely to lose all credibility as is an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position When I was a freshman in high school I won second prize in our local newspaper s essay contest on the theme of future career I wrote about wanting to become a journalist We had to collect our prizes at the local variety store and while waiting in line a little notebook in the stationery department caught my eye It was a black and red hardcover book with the word Record neatly engraved in gold on the cover I reasoned that since I was going to be a journalist I d need a very special notebook in which to write So I bought it But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about it and about becoming a journalist Painting became my great love Upon graduating from high school I went to college as a fine art major and English minor After becoming a professional artist marriage followed then the birth of two daughters A career change came next which led to teaching underprivileged young children in Los Angeles The years passed Then during a serious illness when I was thirty five I found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years earlier From my sick bed I noticed it on a nearby shelf It was still blank but something told me to write my deepest feelings and thoughts my pain and fear my wishes and dreams the words of my inner world This was my first official journal And the process of journal keeping through writing and drawing helped heal me from a mysterious illness which had defied the doctors and their medicines My life changed so much after that I began listening to my own feelings and inner wisdom The insights I gained through journal keeping led me into a new career as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing More importantly I learned to play and enjoy life again For instance several years after recovering from my illness I started skateboarding for the first time in my life and loved it I m grateful to that high school girl that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank book I used it to save my life and to help others Since the beginning of time the mysterious nature of dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were messages from the other world Dreams have been regarded as prophetic communications which when properly decoded would enable us to foretell the future There is however absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory It is certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a traumatic event such as the threat of the loss of a loved one who is sick will dream about that loved one more than would otherwise be the case If the dreamer then calls and finds that the loved one has died it is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition of that death But this is a mistake It is simply a n correspondence between a situation about which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the event that one fears To prove the existence of premonitory dreams scientific evidence must be obtained We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of hits but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams missed To do a scientific study of dream prophecy we would need to establish some base of how commonly coincidental correspondences occur between dream and waking reality Until we have that evidence it is better to believe that the assumption is false The body has been viewed as a natural phenomenon a fixed unchanging fact of nature Recently however it is also being seen as a part of culture in the sense that it can be socially defined in different ways Social definitions of the body are grounded in social relations and influenced by those with the power to promote agreement about what should be considered natural when it comes to the body This new way of thinking about the body has challenged the traditional mind body split that has characterized Western thought since the time of Plato It has also opened up new questions and issues in the sociology of sport Some people in the sociology of sport are now working with colleagues in other disciplines who share interests in the body In their work they are asking critical questions about how the body is trained disciplined and manipulated in sports and how some sport scientists are using technology to probe monitor test evaluate and rehabilitate the body as a performance machine Why eat a cookie Some reasons might be to satisfy your hunger to increase your sugar level or just to have something to chew on However recent success in the packaged cookie market suggests that these may not be the only or perhaps even the most important reasons It appears that cookie producing companies are becoming aware of some other influences and as a result are delivering to the market products resulting from their awareness These relatively new product offerings are usually referred to as soft or chewy cookies to distinguish them from the more typical crunchy varieties Why all the fuss over their introduction Apparently much of their appeal has to do with childhood memories of sitting on the back steps devouring those melt in your mouth cookies that were delivered by Mom straight from the oven while they were still soft This emotional and sensory appeal of soft cookies is apparently at least as strong as are the physical cravings that the product satisfies Unlike the modern society the primitive society has less specialized knowledge to transmit and since its way of life is enacted before the eyes of all it has no need to create a separate institution of education such as the school Instead the child acquires the heritage of his culture by observing and imitating adults in such activities as rituals hunts festivals cultivation and harvesting As a result there is little or none of that alienation of young from old so marked in modern industrial societies A further reason for this alienation in modern societies is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes less to his direct experience and more to the experience of his culture than does primitive man Clearly his debt to culture will vary with the nature of his education Hence the contemporary child must travel much further than the offspring of primitive man to acquire the world view of his elders He is therefore that much more removed from the adults of his society Many people believe that it is critical to share similar if not identical beliefs and values with someone with whom they have a relationship While this may seem preferable it is far from mandatory Individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds have learned to overlook their differences and live harmonious loving lives together I ve seen people from opposite ends of the spectrum economically and politically that ended up in happy lasting marriages I ve seen couples from different ethnic groups merge into harmonious relationships and I ve seen people from different religions come together for a strong lasting bond Furthermore many good friends have little in common except a warm loving feeling of respect and rapport That s the only essential thing People who enjoy the best relationships with others who live life with the least frustration regarding their differences have learned that differences are to be expected a fact of life This understanding must go beyond a mere intellectual I know we re all different You must truly own this idea and incorporate it into your daily life The way I see it we have only two realistic choices We can resist the principle of separate realities and remain frustrated and angry over the fact that no one seems to conform to our way of thinking or we can strive to understand what in Eastern philosophy is called the way of things Separate realities is the way things really are Everyone is unique and has different gifts to offer When we look for these gifts we will surely find them and in doing so we will open the door to a world of personal growth After several futile attempts to teach the role of theme or the prominent repeated melody in classical music the teacher was at wit s end Having reminded her students many times that composers like Wagner depended on the listeners remembering the earlier theme to recognize its later use she was determined to make her students understand that themes recur throughout a piece She knew that her class had little trouble with simple variations and could easily identify themes that were repeated in a similar way But when the theme showed much variation the students attention focused on the new detail to such an extent that they no longer heard the basic theme For a week or two the teacher worried about the problem Other teachers advised her to go on with something else but she continued to search for a solution With this problem in mind one afternoon during the lunch hour she noticed a group of students gathered in a corner of the school yard Several girls were moving their bodies rhythmically Curious she drew closer and found that the students were listening to a new rock hit A girl in the center of the group held a tape recorder in her hand At that moment a sudden inspiration took hold The following day in class she asked how many students had tape recorders A dozen or so students said I do The teacher said excitedly I have an idea Let s play Beethoven s Eroica again One of you can record the theme when it s first introduced Then later someone else can record it the second time it appears Finally we ll have another person record when it appears next Then we can start all three tape recorders at exactly the same time to see if the recordings fit Her students looked at her in surprise Suddenly however delight appeared on their faces And so it was done When they played the recordings simultaneously the sounds blended sufficiently for the students to recognize their commonality Rosalyn s parents did everything possible to avoid favoring one child over the others and this resulted in her feelings being hurt One year Rosalyn asked her mother to prepare a special treat for her birthday the honey cake that Rosalyn had always loved Her mother said she couldn t If she made a honey cake for Rosalyn she d have to make cakes for Rosalyn s two sisters and she didn t have time to make three cakes In the end her mother did give Rosalyn a honey cake on her birthday a really small one because she split the batter for one cake into three parts to treat her daughters equally Upon receiving the cake Rosalyn became disappointed It was after all her birthday couldn t she be singled out on one day of the year A parent s admirable efforts not to play favorites can mean that no child gets the whole cake of parental love Many years ago psychologists performed an experiment in which they put a number of people in a room alone except for a ring toss set It was one of those children s toys with a short wooden post held upright on the floor and a bunch of round rings The subjects were left alone to amuse themselves as best they could As expected with time to kill they began trying to toss the rings around the post What the psychologists discovered was that most of the people moved far enough away from the post so that tossing the rings around it was challenging but not so difficult as to be totally frustrating In other words they deliberately positioned themselves between frustration on the one hand and boredom on the other The process of alternately producing and relieving tension was what made the activity stimulating On the wall of our dining room was a framed quotation Let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man It inspired in me countless childhood daydreams about meeting new people from exotic places I was a child who desperately wanted to connect with others We did live by the side of the road on Route between Keene and Portsmouth but in a place so remote it was extremely difficult to be a friend to man One day when our family drove into town I focused intently on the big paper grocery store signs advertising the same type of produce that we grew carrots cents a bunch tomatoes cents a pound Meanwhile I thought of how the type of imperfect produce we ate for dinner just as healthy as that sold at the store was often tossed on the compost heap or left in the ground The unattractive produce such as crooked carrots and odd looking tomatoes was not valuable to the grocery store where only perfect produce was sold But I knew they would have value to people who would chop them into salads or soups can them or use them to make pies because that is what our family did with them They were fresh and clean and came straight from the good earth Why couldn t others also benefit from that value I could save people the trouble of going into the store by making my produce accessible at the side of the road and that would provide value too Surely I could convince people to pay half of what the grocery store charged and to feel lucky about the bargain Suddenly I saw a connection between those bumpy vegetables on our table and the quotation on the wall I found a way to satisfy my longing for new friends These homely fruits and vegetables would become my golden apples A friend of mine and his wife were in Hawaii standing on a beach watching a beautiful sunset hardly able to believe how magnificent the sight was A woman approached them and overheard my friend s wife say I can t believe how beautiful this is While walking away from the spectacular display the woman said You should have seen it in Tahiti When your attention is not on the present moment but on something else you will tend to compare even good experiences with others as the Tahiti traveler did or you will wonder about future experiences instead of enjoying the present one and regret past experiences because they are already over But as you learn to bring your attention back to the here and now life will come alive again providing the enjoyment and satisfaction it was meant to Thus when you live in the present moment one of the nice things that happens to you is that ordinary everyday life takes on a new significance Taking walks watching a sunset gardening reading a book all begin to feel special When your attention is brought back to the here and now you engage in life rather than think about life Now many kinds of superior coffee beans are being decaffeinated in ways that conserve strong flavor But the public suffers from a groundless fear of chemical decaffeination and prefers instead to buy water processed decaf Every process of decaffeination whether chemical or water based starts with steaming the green beans to loosen the bonds of caffeine In the chemical process a solvent circulates through the beans The solvent comes into direct contact with them carrying the caffeine with it The drained solvent is then mixed with water and the caffeine is drawn out to be sold In the water process however no solvent touches the beans After the beans are steamed they are soaked in water which removes the caffeine along with all the soluble solids in the beans The solution is drained off to a separate tank where the caffeine is drawn out from it Whether their grandchildren have special needs or not grandparents shouldn t overlook the value of incidental learning experiences Every day opportunities exist in the form of errands meal preparation and chores At the farmers market for example a child might discover a new meaning for the word ears when choosing corn Similarly when filling the tank at the gas station older children can compare prices and practice estimation asking questions such as How much do you think it will cost to fill the tank One grandmother hires her grandchildren to help with gardening chores As a result they can learn the names of flowers and understand the tools and processes involved in growing vegetables Activities like these also enhance the value of hard work and persistence Everywhere in the world the issue of how to manage urban growth poses the highest stakes complex policy decisions and strongly heated conflicts in the public area The contrast between Western Europe and America is particularly sharp In Western Europe steep gasoline taxes investment policies favoring built up areas over undeveloped greenfields continuous investment in public transportation and other policies have produced relatively compact cities Cities in Western Europe tend to be economically healthy compared with their suburbs By contrast in the United States cheap gas massive highway investment policies that favor construction on the edges of cities and heavy reliance on property taxes to fund public schools have encouraged much more car reliant and spread out urban areas where eight in ten Americans now live One Saturday during the summer I asked my father if he would go down to the schoolyard and play basketball with me I had just finished the fifth grade and wanted desperately to make the middle school team the coming fall I couldn t believe my ears when he called for my mother and sister to come along for in the traditional fashion my mother was the house accountant the launderer and of course the cook When we arrived my sister immediately ran off to the swings and I recall being annoyed that my mother wasn t following her I dribbled awkwardly around the free throw line almost losing control of the ball and made a flat shot that bounced wildly off the basket The ball fell to my father who took a few not so graceful dribbles and missed an easy layup He rebounded his shot and passed the ball to my mother who had been watching us from the foul line She turned from the basket and began heading the other way Um mah I cried at her my irritation already bubbling over the basket s over here After a few steps she turned around and from where the professional three point line must be now she effortlessly flipped the ball up in the air its flight truer and higher than I d witnessed from any boy or man The ball curved cleanly into the basket stiffly popping the chain link net All afternoon she rained in shot after shot as my father and I ran after her When we got home from the playground my mother showed me the photograph album of her high school days I was shocked to learn that she had been the top player for the national high school team that once won the all Asia championships For years I kept it in my room on the same shelf that housed the scrapbooks I made of basketball stars with magazine clippings of great players such as Bubbles Hawkins Pistol Pete and George Gervin Some scientists have shown the practical power of looking at the world through could be eyes When a group of students were shown an unfamiliar rubbery object and told This could be a dog s chewy toy they were later able to see that it might also be of use as an eraser when they made some pencil mistakes In contrast students who were told that it was a dog s chewy toy did not find its alternative use Another group of students watched a video about physics after being told This presents only one of several outlooks on physics Please feel free to use any additional methods you want to assist you in solving the problems On tests of factual comprehension these students performed no differently from students who had watched the video with a different introduction This presents the outlook on physics Please use the method you see in the video in solving the problems But when they were faced with questions that asked them to use the information more creatively the could be students performed much better than the others Just a simple change of language seemed to invite the students to process and store information in a much more flexible format and thus be able to look at it and make use of it in different ways Why is it that if you tickle yourself it doesn t tickle but if someone else tickles you you cannot stand it If someone was tickling you and you managed to remain relaxed it would not affect you at all Of course it would be difficult to stay relaxed because tickling causes tension for most of us such as feelings of unease The tension is due to physical contact the lack of control and the fear of whether it will tickle or hurt However when you try to tickle yourself you are in complete control of the situation There is no need to get tense and therefore no reaction You will notice the same effect if you close your eyes breathe calmly and manage to relax the next time someone tickles you One of the toughest parts of isolation is a lack of an expressive exit With anger you can get mad at someone and yell With sadness you can cry But isolation feels like being in a room with no way out And the longer you get stuck there the harder it becomes to share the pain and sorrow In isolation hope disappears despair rules and you can no longer see a life beyond the invisible walls that imprison you Some people find it helpful to work gently at driving themselves back into the world In one case a woman reported that after four miserable forced lunches with friends she suddenly enjoyed the fifth one as she found herself laughing at a joke For people who cannot push themselves however support groups are a good cure for isolation They offer the opportunity for connection in a safe and controlled way With the rise of the social sciences and especially the anthropology of the s and thereafter words like savage and primitive began to disappear from the vocabulary of cultural studies along with the notion that the people who had once borne these labels represented a biologically less evolved form of humanity Medical science could find no difference in the brains of the former primitives to account for their different behavior colonists necessarily observed that yesterday s savage might be today s shopkeeper soldier or servant As humanity began to look more like a family of potential equals Westerners had to accept that the behavior found in native cultures was not the distinctive feature of savage otherness but the expression of a capacity that may exist for better or for worse in all of us There is a good reason to make this trip to the Island of Paradise Captain Koppe told himself as he stepped out of the elevator car into the covered rooftop hangar of his house The journey itself would be of use There were times when it was important to be alone to have time to think Alone even from one s personal robot from one s trusted wife Captain Koppe sensed that this was one of those times when he had to be alone if for no other reason than to remind himself that he would have to make his decision alone And he would have the duration of the flight all to himself The thought appealed to him as he powered up the aircar and it lifted a half meter or so off the deck of the hangar The outer doors opened and the aircar slowly eased out into the driving rain Suddenly it was in the middle of the storm jumping and swinging in the darkness the rain crashing down on the windows with incredible violence The storm boomed and roared outside the long range aircar as it fought for altitude the banging and clattering getting worse with every moment Smooth sailing after the storm the aircar arrived at the orbit of the Island of Paradise Captain Koppe looked out at the Island through the window He had been longing for it since his childhood At that moment his family picture posted on the inside of the aircar came into his eyes All of a sudden he had an irresistible urge to go to see his beloved wife and his two sons He turned his back on the Island of Paradise and directed it toward the homeland Footwear has a history which goes back thousands of years and it has long been an article of necessity The earliest footwear was undoubtedly born of the necessity to provide some protection when moving over rough ground in varying weather conditions In ancient times as today the basic type of shoes worn depended on the climate For instance in warmer areas the sandal was and still is the most popular form of footwear whereas the modern moccasin derives from the original shoes adopted in cold climates by races such as Eskimos and Siberians Shoes have not always served such a purely functional purpose however and the requirements of fashion have dictated some curious designs not all of which made walking easy In the early s London Bridge was in trouble Cars trucks and buses were too heavy for it and the bridge was sinking into the Thames river London city officials wanted to build a new bridge and a businessman named Robert McCulloch decided to buy the old bridge and move it to Arizona Workers disassembled the bridge in numbering the bricks and sent them to Los Angeles From there they were taken to Arizona and were reassembled by workers in the Arizona desert The bridge was finally completed in However McCulloch knew he needed more than a famous bridge to attract people to Lake Havasu City so he created an English village with typical English shops and restaurants Today London Bridge is one of Arizona s biggest attractions People who run sports camps think of the children first They do their best to create enjoyable and protective environments in which the children feel comfortable and safe Unfortunately some sports coaches in the camps occasionally become over enthusiastic in their desire to help the children excel As a result they put pressure on them to perform at high levels win at all costs and keep playing even when they get hurt This no pain no gain approach is extremely stressful and leads to unnecessary injuries Parents should therefore take care when they send their children to a sports camp and should talk with the sports coaches to see if they will respect the children s wishes Margo was on holiday with friends three miles off the Kenyan coast in the Indian Ocean in a fishing boat Suddenly the engine died and for mysterious reasons the boat began to sink Before they knew what was happening Margo her three friends and d the African boatman were in the sea They all had life jackets but it was a long way to shore Around them were lots of wooden barrels and boards At that moment e one of the three friends said I don t know how to swim Margo took charge She shouted out orders She told each person to take a wooden board use it as a float and begin kicking slowly toward shore She ordered b the non swimmer to share a piece of board with her Kick softly she told him Don t stir up the water more than you have to With Margo s firm presence next to him the non swimmer avoided panic When every now and then his kicking became awkward and noisy Margo ordered c him to stop Slowly and quietly the five moved toward the distant shore They all reached the beach two hours later exhausted but safe At that time the non swimmer thanked Margo for saving his life and a he asked why she had been so insistent about going slowly and quietly Because she said to him for one thing I knew it was a long way and we had to conserve our energy For another that ocean is full of sharks and I didn t care to attract their attention But if I d told you that you might have panicked and none of us would have made it Every day each of us engages in many types of complex activities We may go to school participate in sports drive cars and sometimes become involved in conflicts We also perform other less complex activities such as eating and sleeping Our nervous system determines the complexity of activities that we are able to perform Animals with nervous systems similar to a worm s cannot play soccer much less chess Why are some activities such as eating and reproducing common to all organisms whereas other activities such as nest building are limited to certain species Why do some animals live in groups and others live alone Questions such as these are the focus of the study of behavior In its simplest form behavior is the conduct of an organism the way it acts You may have had this experience A person calls you on the telephone Apparently assuming you will recognize her voice she does not provide any verbal content which would help you identify her For example you pick up the phone and say Hello and the voice on the other end says Hi how are you doing At this point you realize you dont know who it is So you try to extend the conversation without admitting your ignorance hoping some verbal clues will be given or that you ll eventually recognize the caller s voice As a result you say something like Fine What have you been up to The adult forgets the troubles of his youth Comparing the remembered carefree past with his immediate problems the mature man thinks that troubles belong only to the present The twelve year old the adult thinks does not worry about salary or professional advancement When the roof leaks only the parent worries about what contractor to employ or about how he will repair it himself To the adult then childhood is a time of freedom The child however wishes always to be a man He finds freedom in the future To him adulthood is a time of wealth and his father or mother never needs to worry about saving to buy a bicycle Our bodies have the natural ability to fight off bacteria and diseases when they enter our bodies But there are other diseases that our bodies cannot successfully resist on their own In order to prevent such diseases it is advised that everyone over the age of twenty five should have a regular physical examination During a regular examination a doctor checks weight vision and hearing problems blood pressure and so on The doctor also carries out some special tests to detect such dangerous diseases as cancer and diabetes if necessary The information from both check ups and tests provides important insight into the patient s overall physical condition Hence the time spent on regular examinations is a sensible investment in good health The claim that we have recently entered the information age is misleading Flooded by cellphones the Internet and television we incorrectly imagine that our ancestors inhabited an innocent world where the news did not travel far beyond the village It may not be valid to assume that the media make our time distinct from the past because we know relatively little about how information was shared in the past In fact the Olympics celebrate the memory of the Greek soldier who brought the news of the Athenian victory over the Persians Most of us could come up with many other examples message drums smoke signals church bells ship flags But their primitiveness would only confirm our sense that we live in a fundamentally different world one of constant instant access to information All ages have had a means of sharing information What makes our time distinct is not the density of the data we take in It is the technology that does the transmitting Thanks to satellites we can find out instantly about events that occur on the other side of the world It usually took five weeks for Benjamin Franklin in Paris to receive a letter sent from Philadelphia But the news was still new and surprising to people there I was eight years old At that moment in my life nothing was more important to me than baseball My team was the New York Giants and I followed the doings of those men in the black and orange caps with all the devotion of a true believer Even now remembering that team which no longer exists I can recite the names of nearly every baseball player on the team But none was greater and none more perfect than Willie Mays That spring I was taken to my first big league game Just as we approached the exit after the game I caught sight of Willie Mays He was standing near the gate not ten feet away from me I rushed to him and said Mr Mays could I please have your autograph He said Sure kid You got a pencil I didnt have one in my pocket The great Willie Mays stood there watching in silence He just shrugged and said Sorry kid And then he walked out of the ballpark into the night I didnt want to cry but tears started falling down my cheeks and there was nothing I could do to stop them After that night I started carrying a pencil with me wherever I went It became a habit of mine never to leave the house without making sure I had a pencil in my pocket It s not that I had any particular plans for that pencil but I didnt want to be unprepared I had been caught empty handed once and I wasnt about to let it happen again If nothing else the years have taught me this If there s a pencil in your pocket there s a good chance that one day you ll feel tempted to start using it The rainforests are full of plants and animals that need each other and help each other For example the ant plant has tunnels in its stems which are just right for ants to live in The ants put bits of dead insects inside some of the tunnels and then the ant plant uses them for food The ants also look after a caterpillar which lives inside the ant plant and eats its leaves In return the caterpillar makes a special honey mixture which the ants eat In this way these three all live together in harmony Infrasound is a low pitched sound whose frequency is far below the range of human ears Scientists however have been able to discover the existence of infrasound by using special technologies These new technologies have revealed that many things can produce infrasound from earthquakes and thunderstorms to trains and underground explosions thus making possible the warning of earthquakes and the monitoring of underground nuclear explosion tests These new technologies have another benefit for biologists by allowing them to gain access to the unknown world of communication between animals For centuries biologists believed giraffes were the silent giants of Africa In recent years however biologists have been able to listen more carefully by means of these technologies and have realized that giraffes may talk though not in a way that we can hear Communication through infrasound is not limited to giraffes Over the last few decades biologists have found that whales elephants and some other animals also use this extremely low pitched sound to communicate This infrasound as a means of communication has special merit It can travel a greater distance than higher pitched noise Such long distance communication is a must for animals such as giraffes or elephants that roam over wide areas Our parents cast long shadows over our lives and we become aware of their existence when we are infants Parents first teach us essential ways of living by cautioning Don t touch or It s not nice to do that We may think that we learn these lessons through independent efforts but it s not the way we obtain them at all It is our parents who have given us our sense of right and wrong our understanding of love and our knowledge of who we are As we grow up we see them less and less We leave their homes and we start new families of our own So sometimes we think that we can walk in the sun free of the shadows But still the shadows have not gone We carry their being with us all our lives in the sounds of our voices the look and feel of our skin and the warmth of our hands and our hearts It is only when they are gone and we never see them that we find that they and we are indivisible In fact we have not been able to separate ourselves from them our whole lives long The shadows are still there but they have never really blocked the light at all People are often considered to be rude unintentionally Absorbed in their own thoughts people do not see the motions of someone trying to greet them They may walk right by a friend without noticing him or her Others indeed do not see they are without their contact lenses or are quite nearsighted It is important to take into consideration absent mindedness or poor eyesight before believing that a friend is actually disregarding you One friendship I know of was tense for months because a woman thought she was being ignored by a friend who simply was not wearing her glasses and couldn t see beyond her nose Some speakers frequently look at their watches while giving their speeches They probably do this because they don t want to go over the time they are allowed However it is proven that when a speaker glances at his watch many in the audience do the same thing This becomes an interruption because the audience is not fully focusing on the speech So place your watch on the table in front of you or keep your eye on the clock in the back of the room Our nursing professor gave us a quiz I had easily answered all the questions until I read the last one What is the name of the woman who cleans the school I knew she was tall short haired and in her fifties but how would I know her name I handed in my paper leaving the question blank Collecting the papers the professor said the last question would count Then she added In your careers you will meet many people All are significant They deserve your attention and care even if all you do is smile and say hello I ve never forgotten that lesson I also learned that her name was Dorothy Everyone makes decisions every day What clothes should you wear Should you go out tonight or stay home and study Most of the decisions people make are based on what they feel will be the best solution Feelings and judgments of how others feel toward you play a major role in how you choose to solve your day to day problems True problem solving however goes beyond feelings To solve a problem you must look beyond how you feel and combine information that you already know with new observations Then on the basis of your knowledge of the situation you can evaluate the problem and come up with the best way to solve it An example will make this point clear Imagine that it s Saturday and you are to meet your friends at the mall at You ve been busy all morning and suddenly you notice it is You hurry to get ready and then jump in the car What route is probably the fastest You know where the mall is and you choose the best route based on what you know about the distance the number of stop lights and the amount of traffic In short you make observations and make your best guesses based on what you know and have observed When a dog is trained to detect drugs explosives contraband or other items the trainer doesn t actually teach the dog how to smell the dog already knows how to discriminate one scent from another Rather the dog is trained to become emotionally aroused by one smell versus another In the step by step training process the trainer attaches an emotional charge to a particular scent so that the dog is drawn to it above all others And then the dog is trained to search out the desired item on cue so that the trainer can control or release the behavior This emotional arousal is also why playing tug with a dog is a more powerful emotional reward in a training regime than just giving a dog a food treat since the trainer invests more emotion into a game of tug From a dog s point of view the tug toy is compelling because the trainer is upset by the toy Notation was more than a practical method for preserving an expanding repertoire of music It changed the nature of the art itself To write something down means that people far away in space and time can re create it At the same time there are downsides Written notes freeze the music rather than allowing it to develop in the hands of individuals and it discourages improvisation Partly because of notation modern classical performance lacks the depth of nuance that is part of aural tradition Before notation arrived in all history music was largely carried on as an aural tradition Most world music is still basically aural including sophisticated musical traditions such as Indian and Balinese Most jazz musicians can read music but often don t bother and their art is much involved with improvisation Many modern pop musicians one example being Paul McCartney can t read music at all Marshall McLuhan among others noted that clothes are people s extended skin wheels extended feet camera and telescopes extended eyes Our technological creations are great extrapolations of the bodies that our genes build In this way we can think of technology as our extended body During the industrial age it was easy to see the world this way Steam powered shovels locomotives television and the levers and gears of engineers were a fabulous exoskeleton that turned man into superman The blueprints for our shells spring from our minds which may spontaneously create something none of our ancestors ever made or even imagined If technology is an extension of humans it is not an extension of our genes but of our minds Technology is therefore the extended body for ideas A closer look reveals the flaw in this analogy The extended costume of animals is the result of their genes They inherit the basic blueprints of what they make Humans don t We seek out feel good experiences always on the lookout for the next holiday purchase or culinary experience This approach to happiness is relatively recent it depends on our capacity both to pad our lives with material pleasures and to feel that we can control our suffering Painkillers as we know them today are a relatively recent invention and access to material comfort is now within reach of a much larger proportion of the world s population These technological and economic advances have had significant cultural implications leading us to see our negative experiences as a problem and maximizing our positive experiences as the answer Yet through this we have forgotten that being happy in life is not just about pleasure Comfort contentment and satisfaction have never been the elixir of happiness Rather happiness is often found in those moments we are most vulnerable alone or in pain Happiness is there on the edges of these experiences and when we get a glimpse of that kind of happiness it is powerful transcendent and compelling Whispering galleries are remarkable acoustic spaces found beneath certain domes or curved ceilings A famous one is located outside a well known restaurant in New York City s Grand Central Station It s a fun place to take a date the two of you can exchange romantic words while you re forty feet apart and separated by a busy passageway You ll hear each other clearly but the passersby won t hear a word you re saying To produce this effect the two of you should stand at diagonally opposite corners of the space facing the wall That puts you each near a focus a special point at which the sound of your voice gets focused as it reflects off the passageway s curved walls and ceiling Ordinarily the sound waves you produce travel in all directions and bounce off the walls at different times and places scrambling them so much that they are inaudible when they arrive at the ear of a listener forty feet away But when you whisper at a focus the reflected waves all arrive at the same time at the other focus thus reinforcing one another and allowing your words to be heard After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in made the term sustainability widely known around the world the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as pro environmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior It became a public relations term an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm But then in a decade or so some governments industries educational institutions and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing green products but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions When Master Brooks played a Mozart piece on the violin for his class to learn the room was filled with waves of beautiful soul stirring sound The class tried to emulate the music played by this renowned guest musician Among the students in the class Joe Brooks was by far the best In fact Joe was the master s son His father had placed a baby violin in his hands at the age of four and Joe was a natural talent Now just twelve years later he was already on his way to becoming a virtuoso like his father After the class Joe was alone with his father He had something important to talk about Joe took a deep breath and said I have been asked to play in a concert and I would like your permission first It is a crossover concert Master Brooks looked surprised Indeed the master s dislike of crossover music was no secret Father Joe took a deep breath and continued I respect your views but it is not what you think Why don t you come and listen to our practice tomorrow If you don t like it I will cancel Well did you get permission asked Brian as soon as Joe entered the practice room the following day Um I m not sure answered Joe without confidence You can tell us about it after practice Brian said as he placed his fingers on the keyboard Beside him Nick was tuning his guitar Joe thought that he would play just one last time before telling them that he might pull out of the concert The trio swung into their routine as easily as only a group that had practiced long and hard together could When they finished practicing Joe noticed his father standing in the corner Wow that was quite wonderful he said with admiration Master Brooks came toward his son I love the way you created those unique sounds while keeping the spirit of the violin I underestimated the power that crossover music can create said Master Brooks to him Joe and his father returned home both humming the melody that the band had been practicing While being an introvert comes with its challenges it definitely has its advantages as well For example an introvert is far less likely to make a mistake in a social situation such as inadvertently insulting another person whose opinion is not agreeable An introvert would enjoy reflecting on their thoughts and thus would be far less likely to suffer from boredom without outside stimulation The only risk that you will face as an introvert is that people who do not know you may think that you are aloof or that you think you are better than them If you learn how to open up just a little bit with your opinions and thoughts you will be able to thrive in both worlds You can then stay true to your personality without appearing to be antisocial A carbon sink is a natural feature that absorbs or stores more carbon than it releases The value of carbon sinks is that they can help create equilibrium in the atmosphere by removing excess CO One example of a carbon sink is a large forest Its mass of plants and other organic material absorb and store tons of carbon However the planet s major carbon sink is its oceans Since the Industrial Revolution began in the eighteenth century CO released during industrial processes has greatly increased the proportion of carbon in the atmosphere Carbon sinks have been able to absorb about half of this excess CO and the world s oceans have done the major part of that job They absorb about one fourth of humans industrial carbon emissions doing half the work of all Earth s carbon sinks combined Promoting attractive images of one s country is not new but the conditions for trying to create soft power have changed dramatically in recent years For one thing nearly half the countries in the world are now democracies In such circumstances diplomacy aimed at public opinion can become as important to outcomes as traditional classified diplomatic communications among leaders Information creates power and today a much larger part of the world s population has access to that power Technological advances have led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of processing and transmitting information The result is an explosion of information and that has produced a paradox of plenty Plentiful information leads to scarcity of attention When people are overwhelmed with the volume of information confronting them they have difficulty knowing what to focus on Attention rather than information becomes the scarce resource and those who can distinguish valuable information from background clutter gain power Tourism takes place simultaneously in the realm of the imagination and that of the physical world In contrast to literature or film it leads to real tangible worlds while nevertheless remaining tied to the sphere of fantasies dreams wishes and myth It thereby allows the ritual enactment of mythological ideas There is a considerable difference as to whether people watch a film about the Himalayas on television and become excited by the untouched nature of the majestic mountain peaks or whether they get up and go on a trek to Nepal Even in the latter case they remain at least partly in an imaginary world They experience moments that they have already seen at home in books brochures and films Their notions of untouched nature and friendly innocent indigenous people will probably be confirmed But now this confirmation is anchored in a physical experience The myth is thus transmitted in a much more powerful way than by television movies or books Humans can tell lies with their faces Although some are specifically trained to detect lies from facial expressions the average person is often misled into believing false and manipulated facial emotions One reason for this is that we are two faced By this I mean that we have two different neural systems that manipulate our facial muscles One neural system is under voluntary control and the other works under involuntary control There are reported cases of individuals who have damaged the neural system that controls voluntary expressions They still have facial expressions but are incapable of producing deceitful ones The emotion that you see is the emotion they are feeling since they have lost the needed voluntary control to produce false facial expressions There are also clinical cases that show the flip side of this coin These people have injured the system that controls their involuntary expressions so that the only changes in their demeanor you will see are actually willed expressions Princess a solid Boxer had been given to Rita when she was ten weeks old and Rita immediately bonded with her petting her feeding her teaching her basic commands and letting her sleep on Rita s bed The two were always together and within arm s reach The only time they were apart was when Rita was learning to swim Princess had a fear of water that was so extreme that she couldn t even touch the water Princess fears stemmed from her puppyhood when she almost drowned twice These early traumas made water the only thing that Princess truly feared When she came close to a body of water she would try to pull back and seemed emotionally distressed Would she ever be able to overcome this fear She had a chance one late afternoon when Rita s mother took them to a shopping mall It was located along the edge of a lake and featured a wooden boardwalk which was built along the shore While her mother headed to a store Rita and Princess began to play on the boardwalk Suddenly a boy riding a bicycle slipped on the damp wooden surface hitting Rita at an angle which propelled her through an open section of the guard rail She let out a scream of pain and fear as she fell into the water She then continued to cry for help and struggle to get out Upon hearing Rita s cry her mother rushed to the railing shouting for help from the entrance of the store a hundred feet or so away Princess was looking at the water and trembling in fear She stood there staring at the water the one thing that had nearly taken her life Her love for Rita overpowered her fear and she leapt out through the same open space in the railing and plunged into the water Once in the water Princess quickly found Rita and slowly dragged her to the shore to her grateful mother Since the concept of a teddy bear is very obviously not a genetically inherited trait we can be confident that we are looking at a cultural trait However it is a cultural trait that seems to be under the guidance of another genuinely biological trait the cues that attract us to babies high foreheads and small faces Cute baby like features are inherently appealing producing a nurturing response in most humans Teddy bears that had a more baby like appearance however slight this may have been initially were thus more popular with customers Teddy bear manufacturers obviously noticed which bears were selling best and so made more of these and fewer of the less popular models to maximize their profits In this way the selection pressure built up by the customers resulted in the evolution of a more baby like bear by the manufacturers It takes time to develop and launch products Consequently many companies know months ahead of time that they will be launching a new product In order to create interest in the product companies will often launch pre market advertising campaigns In the nutrition industry articles are often written discussing a new nutrient under investigation Over a series of issues you begin to see more articles discussing this new nutrient and potential to enhance training and or performance Then after months a new product is coincidentally launched that contains the ingredient that has been discussed in previous issues Books and supplement reviews have also been used as vehicles to promote the sale of fitness and nutrition products This marketing technique is called demand creation It involves creating a buzz about a new potentially revolutionary nutrient or training technique through publishing articles and or books that stimulate the reader s interest Once this is done a new product is launched There s a direct counterpart to pop music in the classical song more commonly called an art song which does not focus on the development of melodic material Both the pop song and the art song tend to follow tried and true structural patterns And both will be published in the same way with a vocal line and a basic piano part written out underneath But the pop song will rarely be sung and played exactly as written the singer is apt to embellish that vocal line to give it a styling just as the accompanist will fill out the piano part to make it more interesting and personal The performers might change the original tempo and mood completely You won t find such extremes of approach by the performers of songs by Franz Schubert or Richard Strauss These will be performed note for note because both the vocal and piano parts have been painstakingly written down by the composer with an ear for how each relates to the other In mature markets breakthroughs that lead to a major change in competitive positions and to the growth of the market are rare Because of this competition becomes a zero sum game in which one organization can only win at the expense of others However where the degree of competition is particularly intense a zero sum game can quickly become a negative sum game in that everyone in the market is faced with additional costs As an example of this when one of the major high street banks in Britain tried to gain a competitive advantage by opening on Saturday mornings it attracted a number of new customers who found the traditional Monday Friday bank opening hours to be a constraint However faced with a loss of customers the competition responded by opening on Saturdays as well The net effect of this was that although customers benefited the banks lost out as their costs increased but the total number of customers stayed the same In essence this proved to be a negative sum game In fiber processing the word spinning means two quite different things One is the formation of individual fibers by squeezing a liquid through one or more small openings in a nozzle called a spinneret and letting it harden Spiders and silkworms have been spinning fibers in this way for millions of years but chemists and engineers learned the procedure from them only about a century ago In the other kind of spinning sometimes called throwing to prevent confusion with the first kind two or more fibers are twisted together to form a thread Human beings discovered this art thousands of years ago and they have invented several devices to make it easier and faster The ancient distaff and spindle are examples that were replaced by the spinning wheel in the Middle Ages Later came the spinning jenny the water frame and Crompton s mule spinning machines that became symbols of the Industrial Revolution Andrew steadied his eyes upon the black and white squares He thought awhile before pushing his knight to an unbeatable position Now Andrew was sure he had beaten Timothy Tandon the winner of the National Chess Championship Andrew whom nobody had noticed before the tournament this year came to progress to the final match After enjoying this memorable victory Andrew headed straight to the nursing home where his sick grandad was staying When Andrew reached the nursing home Grandad was sitting up in bed You won the semi final he asked offering up a weak smile Andrew nodded his head Indeed Andrew s grandad was his chess master As a kid Andrew liked to observe Grandad play chess and often predicted his moves even before he began to move the pieces Andrew said Grandad inspired by his grandson s superb victory you are now all set to fulfill my dream Tomorrow you will surely win the National Chess Championship It was the day of the final match That morning Andrew had received a call from the nursing home informing him that Grandad s condition had become serious The news played upon Andrew s mind as he started to play After several fierce battles Andrew s concentration wavered for a moment His mind travelled to his grandad who was in another battle for his life It was then that Andrew made a big mistake The mistake was a fatal one and it was all over He had lost Andrew arrived at the nursing home in a gloomy mood but he was blessed with good news His grandad was recovering Andrew was greatly delighted but he could not help being disappointed in a corner of his mind I tried my best to fulfill your dream but I couldn t make it Andrew said in disappointment That s all right said Grandad The real lesson of chess is learning how to tame your mind See my mind has won the battle over my body I will recover soon and see you become champion one day in perfect health Andrew was relieved and smiled with joy Roles are like a fence They allow us a certain amount of freedom but for most of us that freedom doesn t go very far Suppose that a woman decides that she is not going to wear dresses or a man that he will not wear suits and ties regardless of what anyone says In most situations they ll stick to their decision When a formal occasion comes along however such as a family wedding or a funeral they are likely to cave in to norms that they find overwhelming Almost all of us follow the guidelines for what is appropriate for our roles Few of us are bothered by such restrictions for our socialization is so thorough that we usually want to do what our roles indicate is appropriate The ancient Greeks sought to improve memory through brain training methods such as memory palaces and the method of loci At the same time they and the Egyptians became experts at externalizing information inventing the modern library a grand storehouse for externalized knowledge We don t know why these simultaneous explosions of intellectual activity occurred when they did perhaps daily human experience had hit a certain level of complexity But the human need to organize our lives our environment even our thoughts remains strong This need isn t simply learned it is a biological imperative animals organize their environments instinctively Most mammals are biologically programmed to put their digestive waste away from where they eat and sleep Dogs have been known to collect their toys and put them in baskets ants carry off dead members of the colony to burial grounds certain birds and rodents create barriers around their nests in order to more easily detect invaders Imitation seems to be a key to the transmission of valuable practices among nonhumans The most famous example is that of the macaque monkeys on the island of Koshima in Japan In the early s Imo a one year old female macaque somehow hit upon the idea of washing her sweet potatoes in a stream before eating them Soon it was hard to find a Koshima macaque who wasn t careful to wash off her sweet potato before eating it A few years later Imo introduced another innovation Researchers on the island occasionally gave the monkeys wheat in addition to sweet potatoes But the wheat was given to them on the beach where it quickly became mixed with sand Imo though realized that if you threw a handful of wheat and sand into the ocean the sand would sink and the wheat would float Again within a few years most of her fellow macaques were throwing wheat and sand into the sea and obtaining the benefits In humans body clocks are responsible for daily changes in blood pressure body temperature hormones hunger and thirst as well as our sleep wake cycles These biological rhythms which we experience as internal time are probably older than sleep developed over the course of millions of years of evolution They facilitate physiological and behavioral changes on a roughly twenty four hour cycle no matter what is happening outside whether a cold front moves in or clouds block the light of the sun That is why people experience jet lag when traveling across time zones Their internal clocks continue to run in accordance with the place they left behind not the one to which they have come and it can take some time to realign the two The most remarkable thing is that our internal body clocks can be readjusted by environmental cues We may get jet lag for a few days when we ask our body clocks to adapt to a vastly different schedule of day and night cycles on the other side of the Earth but they can do it The customer service representatives in an electronics firm under major restructuring were told they had to begin selling service contracts for their equipment in addition to installing and repairing them This generated a great deal of resistance To the service representatives learning to sell was a very different game from what they had been playing But it turned out they already knew a lot more about sales than they thought For example the first step in servicing or installing equipment is talking with the clients to understand how they used the equipment The same is true in selling The salesperson first has to learn about the customer s needs The service representatives also had a great deal of product knowledge and hands on experience which is obviously important in sales Richard was watching people on the street through the window Skirts were bouncing lightly and pants were dancing delightedly in the seasonable weather as the spring breeze chased them playfully Some seemed excited walking like racing cars between passersby He had ordered two black coffees one for himself and one for his friend Julie She was running late but the service was fast The hot coffees were promptly placed in front of him Looking at the coffees Richard remembered that Julie liked whipped cream on top of her hot coffee He was wondering if it was better to put the cream on now or wait till she arrived Since the cream is cold it ll cool down the coffee faster he reasoned Beep It was a text message from her I ll be there in minutes Please put some cream on my coffee He was startled because she seemed to know what he was thinking about Richard called over a waiter wearing a blue shirt and asked him for whipped cream Handing a spray can of cream over to Richard the waiter said Add it now if you want Richard couldn t help asking him why The blue shirted man answered Actually hotter coffee loses energy faster than coffee cooled slightly by the addition of cream Really Is that so The waiter kindly smiled and said Yeah I just learned it when I took a class about coffee He also taught his customer how to make shapes with the cream Richard paid close attention to his explanation Richard thanked the waiter Following his instructions Richard made a flower with the cream He tried to be as precise as he could No sooner had he completed his masterpiece Julie stepped into the cafe As she sat down she saw her coffee Wow look at that A white flower in the cup It looks so beautiful Richard It s too lovely to drink his friend said Try it the happy man urged her She tasted it This coffee is absolutely delicious too Talking and laughing over coffee they enjoyed the fabulous spring day School physical education programs should offer a balanced variety of activities that allow young people to develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally meaningful and enjoyable A balance should exist in any physical education program among team dual and individual lifetime sports Team sports such as basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing together as a team However in many school physical education programs team sports dominate the curriculum at the expense of various individual and dual sports like tennis swimming badminton and golf In such cases the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in activities that they can participate in throughout their adult lives Only through a balanced program of team dual and individual sports is it possible to develop well rounded individuals Cultural characteristics are not only passed from parents to children but may be passed on from any one individual to another by word of mouth or by writing So some cultural changes may be adopted quite quickly by a whole population Transmission of culture is rather like transmission of an infection Flu and colds spread very quickly especially with the large amount of contact that people now have with each other Like those infectious diseases cultural habits such as pop music preferences and clothing fashions may spread very quickly nowadays especially through the media of radio and television However other deep rooted cultural characteristics of races and racial subgroups are much more difficult to change These are the cultural patterns that are so resistant to alteration that they have the appearance of being inherent The timing of positive versus negative behavior seems to influence attraction Several studies have identified what has been called the loss gain effect This effect reflects what happens to attraction when a person s behavior moves from positive to negative or from negative to positive For example if someone seemed very nice to you early in the interaction but then began to act like a fool would you be more attracted to that person than if that person were a fool from the start Studies suggest that you would not In fact people are more attracted to individuals who are consistently negative than to people who initially behave positively and then switch to negative behavior The reason is this people who start out being nice get our hopes up so the letdown we experience when we discover that they are not nice makes it worse than if they had acted badly from the start Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be easily confused Imagine cooking a very large pot of chicken soup on the stove Let s suppose you heat the soup until it is quite hot You grab a spoon and take out a spoonful of soup to taste As you remove the spoonful of soup from the pot it has the same temperature as the larger sample Unfortunately as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it the spoon slips from your hand pouring its contents on your bare foot The spoonful of soup hitting your foot hurts but not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the entire pot of soup on your foot If both the spoonful and the pot full of soup have the same temperature why would the larger sample cause more damage if it came in contact with your skin The answer to the question lies in the difference between temperature and heat People make extensive use of searching images One unexpected context is sorting Suppose you have a bag of small hardware screws nails and so on and you decide to organize them into little jars You dump the stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into coherent groups It is possible to do this by randomly picking up individual objects one by one identifying each one and then moving it to the appropriate jar But what most people do is very different They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the same type making a handful of say small screws They put them in the jar and then go back and do the same for a different kind of item So the sorting sequence is nonrandom producing runs of items of a single type It is a faster more efficient technique and much of the increased efficiency is due to the use of searching images In when the land was up for sale grandpa bought two hundred acres from the Granger family In he bought another two hundred It was good rich land However there were bank loans for and taxes on the land Unfortunately there had not been enough money from the cotton to pay both of them and live on To make things worse the price of cotton dropped in That was why papa had gone to work ending up in Louisiana in He set out looking for work first going far north and south and finally west into Louisiana It was there he found work laying track for the railroad He worked the remainder of the year away from us not returning until the deep winter The following spring after the planting was finished he did the same Now it was and papa was again in Louisiana laying track When he came back from Louisiana I asked papa why he had to go away and why the land was so important He took my hand and said in his quiet way Look out there Cassie All that belongs to you You will never have to live on other people s land As long as the family survives you will have your own place That s important You may not understand now but one day you will I looked at papa strangely for I knew that all the land did not belong to me Some of it belonged to Stacey Christopher and John not to mention the part that belonged to big mama and mama However papa never divided the land in his mind it was simply the land of our family For it he would work the long hot summer pounding steel mama would teach and run the farm and big mama in her sixties would work like a woman in her twenties in the cotton fields and keep the house but always the taxes would be paid Papa said that one day I would understand B Organic farmers grow crops that are no less plagued by pests than those of conventional farmers insects generally do not discriminate between organic and conventional as well as we do It is true that they are far more likely than conventional farmers to practice environmentally beneficial forms of biological control and that they are also more likely to sensibly diversify their crops to reduce infestation However most organic farmers have no choice but to rely on chemicals as necessary supplements to their operations With pests often consuming up to percent of the crops grown in the United States they do so as a matter of course They might refer to these substances as botanical extracts But according to Ned Groth a senior scientist at Consumers Union these toxins are not necessarily less worrisome because they are natural Jason always seemed to have a tough time in classes except in the ones where he could do something In the classes in which the teachers just stood and talked or told everyone to read he seemed to get bored and restless But the ones in which he could get up and do things like industrial arts drama science projects or P E were always his favorites He soon realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner he was a kinesthetic learner Once he figured this out he started to use this information to his advantage He would draw out what he learned from class on notes posters and doodles He would act out things and work with other students on projects using role play and drama This helped his learning come alive and he was less bored As a result he not only enjoyed school more but his grades also went up In Australia a few years ago I met a remarkable man named John Walton He has since become a close friend He told me that when he started out in life he seemed to be caught in a peculiar failure pattern Whatever he tried would start out well and then end up badly As a schoolboy he dropped out of several schools for this reason He became convinced that it was his destiny in life to make good beginnings and then watch them fade away At one point John got a job with the Australian division of a famous American company The same dreary pattern seemed to be unfolding He started out well and then things began to slide This didn t surprise him much it was what he expected to happen Then the company sent a motivational speaker out to give some talks to their Australian employees and John was in the audience The visitor told his listeners to visualize themselves moving up in the company receiving promotions gaining energy as they went right up to the very top The speaker also said Most of you are letting the fear of failure hold you back All the ingredients of success are right there inside you if you ll just turn your thinking around Don t keep telling yourself you can t do this or you can t do that You can do ANYTHING if you think you can John had never heard anything like this in his whole life He realized for the first time that his image of himself as a person who started well and then faded away was all in his head a state of mind that could be altered any time he made a firm decision to alter it John went back to work with tremendous enthusiasm and confidence and energy He received promotions He became the manager of a branch in New South Wales Finally he became the head of the company for all of Australia Where once he had been dogged by failure now everything he did was crowned by success He told me It was that one talk that changed my self image by giving it a little twist It made me see myself differently and so I was different A People believe that good books are educational and useful to academic success However it appears that the nature of written language itself helps increase academic achievement regardless of a book s quality Even books that provide only pleasure will increase the confidence of students and encourage them to try to read more technical materials in school Comics magazines audiobooks and topics of interest on the Internet are sometimes not considered real reading materials However these materials let students enjoy the pleasure of reading and gain information literacy skills and more This light reading is actually very beneficial because it is effortless reading which improves reading fluency Jason always seemed to have a tough time in classes except in the ones where he could do something In the classes in which the teachers just stood and talked or told everyone to read he seemed to get bored and restless But the ones in which he could get up and do things like industrial arts drama science projects or P E were always his favorites He soon realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner he was a

Lemonade is the perfect refreshment on a sunny day and it also contains a lot of vitamin C Here s a quick and easy way to make lemonade Prepare four lemons g of sugar one liter of water and some ice You also need a bowl a jug and a spoon Don t forget to prepare a cutting board and a knife Wash the lemons you ve prepared and cut them in half Then squeeze out as much juice as you can into a bowl You can squeeze the lemons by hand but it s easier if you use a lemon squeezer Then simply mix together the lemon juice sugar and water in a jug and stir Pour it into a glass add some ice and enjoy your lemonade Zach was a year old boy and he was a good swimmer He advanced to the meter freestyle final Although there were many competitors Zach knew that the winner should be between him and Tony They were best friends but Zach considered him as his biggest competitor They both were great swimmers and had won an equal number of races To prepare for the race both Zach and Tony bought a specially made swimming suit that could minimize resistance against water and help them swim faster But they found out that this type of special suit had not been allowed in previous races Both Zach and Tony asked the swimming coach if they could wear it He said that he would let them know before the race On the other hand Zach s conscience whispered that a true victory comes from fair competition After a long conflict he finally decided to be honest He told Tony about the suit and they both joined the race wearing the suits Tony won the race and Zach congratulated him This was the sweetest second place Zach had ever won Nothing was decided during the morning but shortly before the race the coach told Zach that he and Tony could wear the suit He asked Zach to tell Tony about it After hearing what his coach said Zach faced a difficult choice At first he hesitated to tell his friend about the news He thought that if he did not tell Tony about it he would definitely win the race According to sociologists one of the most widespread and basic norms of human culture is embodied in the rule for reciprocation The rule requires that one person try to repay in kind what another person has provided By obligating the recipient of an act to repayment in the future the rule for reciprocation allows one individual to give something to another with confidence that it is not being lost This sense of future obligation within the rule makes possible the development of various kinds of continuing relationships transactions and exchanges that are beneficial to the society Consequently all members of the society are trained from childhood to follow the rule or suffer serious social disapproval Several plane crashes and near crashes have been attributed to dangerous downward wind bursts known as wind shear These wind bursts generally result from high speed downdrafts in the turbulence of thunderstorms but they can occur in clear air when rain evaporates high above the ground The downdraft spreads out when it hits the ground and forms an inward circular pattern A plane entering the pattern experiences an unexpected upward headwind that lifts the plane To resist it the pilot often cuts speed and lowers the plane s nose to compensate Further into the circular pattern the wind quickly turns downward and an airplane can suddenly lose altitude and possibly crash when it is near the ground as upon landing The underlying idea of world history is that the interaction among human societies resembles not the relationships among billiard balls but rather among bacteria Billiard balls rolling around the table may collide and affect each other s trajectories but they do not actually change each other The eight ball is an eight ball even after it is struck by the cue ball Bacteria however fundamentally shape each other as they interact Because the membranes covering bacteria are full of pores bacteria can exchange genetic information and can even fundamentally alter each other s basic make up when they touch Similarly human societies in contact affect each other s development World historians recognizing this seek to understand human history through studying both developments within societies and the way in which societies relate to each other We are not the only species to give sometimes wrongheaded deference to those in authority positions In monkey colonies where rigid dominance hierarchies exist beneficial innovations do not spread quickly through the group unless they are taught first to a dominant animal When a lower animal is taught the new concept first the rest of the colony remains mostly oblivious to its value One study on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese monkeys provides a nice illustration In one troop a taste for caramels was developed by introducing this new food into the diet of young minors low on the status ladder The taste for caramels inched slowly up the ranks A year and a half later only percent of the colony had acquired it and still none of the leaders Contrast this with what happened in a second troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader Wheat eating to this point unknown to these monkeys spread through the whole colony within four hours The first memory I have of visiting a working artist s studio is a trip my family took to the studio of Grey Stone a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole family has cherished for many years When I was about five years old our family drove down to his studio with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery from the family collection We wanted Grey to make a set that would draw together the pieces we had collected over the years Even at that young age looking around Grey s house and studio complex I thought about how great it was that he could work at home with his family around him and produce things with his own hands After accepting our request he immediately started working on one of the pieces Taking a prepared lump of clay he put it on his treadle wheel It was so fascinating to see how ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot I couldn t get that process out of my head so I looked forward to our return trip several months later to pick up the finished dinnerware One of my favorite features of each piece Grey had made was that upon close inspection one could see that the pieces had been individually inscribed with some marks on the underside just inside the trimmed foot On each of those pieces with the large foot area there was room for the inscription not only of the potter s signature address and date but also a unique saying or phrase A favorite family pastime then developed when guests came over and we got out the good stoneware Before my father served the food he would encourage guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the underside Thanks to his influence this childhood pastime has since become a habit Even today I still flip over all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch them to see if there might be an inscription or at least to look for the potter s mark A few years ago we purchased a brand new camper van Not long after we bought our camper a friend of ours asked if her family could borrow it We were not too interested in loaning out our spotless camper so we declined This happened in the fall and we stored the camper in our backyard all that winter In the spring my husband and I were setting it up to prepare for a trip We were very surprised to find that we had left cookie boxes in the camper over the winter We had moved and had a baby that previous summer and fall and cleaning out the camper had been overlooked That in itself would not have been so bad had it not been for the mice Mice were attracted by the food and they shredded all the curtains screens and cushions Had we let the friend borrow the camper she would have discovered the boxes before the mice did Across the Arctic polar bear numbers are in decline If the climate continues to warm at the current rate the bears could disappear completely in the next hundred years But for now if you visit Churchill Canada in October or November it s almost a sure thing you ll see a polar bear in the wild Churchill population sits on the edge of Hudson Bay at the point where the ice first forms every winter And these bears love ice Their fondness for frozen seas is simple Ice means they can eat their favorite meal seals Although polar bears are powerful marine mammals able to swim a hundred miles or more nonstop they re too slow to catch a seal in open water But when ice forms they can walk out to a hole near where the seals are swimming then sit and wait for a seal to pop its head up to breathe Or as a bear might put it Dinner is served I observe the moon wherever I go What phase is it in I wonder When will it reach the full moon phase Now imagine what happened to me recently when I was teaching in Australia miles from my hometown in North America Shortly after my arrival seeing that the skies were cloudy I checked the newspaper for a weather report Typically the weather page also gives times for sunrise and sunset as well as moonrise and moonset Picture my surprise when I discovered that the illustrations in the newspaper were by my experience wrong The waxing moon appeared to be illuminated on the left side rather than the right side as I had always known it to be I must call the newspaper I thought But I continued to study the images in the newspaper and then consulted a globe When I imagined myself standing on a spot in the southern hemisphere the answer came to me Here indeed south of the equator the waxing moon appears to be on the left Try this in your imagination and you will see it too The point is that often we do not see things as they are Instead we see things as we are That is why it is necessary in science to have many people making many observations of the same phenomenon I am sure that to people in Australia the moon in North America would seem strange as well Beethoven took scraps of paper with him on his frequent walks writing down his musical ideas as they came to him At home he kept large sketchbooks into which he might copy the results or enter new ideas fashioning and refashioning the music crossing it out and starting again After Beethoven s death these sketchbooks were scattered and in many cases broken up Fortunately one of the most sustained research programs in postwar musicology has succeeded in reconstructing their original sequence As a result you can work through them and trace the painful process by which Beethoven edged toward the music that we know For instance while the first section of the Ode to Joy seems to have come to him with little difficulty the middle section gave him enormous trouble there is sketch upon sketch in which Beethoven tries one idea then another And you find that the most characteristic and expressive features of the music come together only during the final stages of the compositional process Jim performed fieldwork in Lesotho a small nation in Africa There studying and interacting with local villagers he patiently earned their trust until one day he was asked to join in one of their songs Jim replied in a soft voice I don t sing and it was true Although he was an excellent oboe player he was unable to sing a simple melody The villagers found his response puzzling They just stared at Jim and said What do you mean you don t sing You talk Jim recalls later It was as odd to them as if I told them that I couldn t walk or dance even though I have both my legs That s because singing and dancing were a natural activity in their lives involving everyone Their word for singing ho bina also means to dance there is no distinction since it is assumed that singing involves bodily movement Sometimes someone saying you can t do something is good for you It builds mental toughness and conviction I often tell people Anyone with young children will tell you if you ask them not to do something they re guaranteed to do it The following story is an example of how my dad used this to a his and ultimately my advantage As a child I wasn t particularly academic or ambitious and certainly didn t work very hard at my studies It wasn t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh grade and facing the prospect of leaving school without any sense of what I wanted to do as a career that I decided to apply to the local college to pursue further study Feeling pleased with myself for having made this monumental decision I proudly announced my plan to my dad e His immediate reaction was to say You ll never do that They ll never accept you I was so annoyed and upset by b his response that I worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year In those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended up winning three awards at the end of year prize giving The best part was being able to tell my dad that I d been awarded a place at college On hearing this news he simply lowered his newspaper and with a smile said Well done I always knew you would At that moment I realized what c he had done by discouraging me This was my first experience of reverse psychology Some people might say it s a risky strategy but it has certainly worked for me It has been extremely valuable in my life giving me the confidence determination and motivation to succeed even when the odds are stacked against me Now as a father myself I sometimes use the same technique to motivate my own son Often enough he ends up with favorable results I just hope one day d he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind For thousands of years farmers at harvest time have selected seeds cuttings or tubers from superior plants to save for the next planting Farmers often protected the stored seeds from insects or animals by sealing them in clay pots or burying them in baskets covered with ash They also often stored tubers in cold areas and either replanted cuttings immediately or kept them dry until the next planting time Farmers thus saved their genetic stocks from season to season They could exchange remaining stocks with neighbors or exchange them in the local market Due to this trade the plant variety became widespread in a region Organized seed production however did not begin until the early s When we look at the world and ourselves we do it through a set of filters Think about what a filter is A filter is a mechanism that lets some things flow in but screens other things out Depending on what the filter is made up of it can also alter whatever is looked at or passes through it Sunglasses are a good example of a visual filter But obviously I am not talking here about some physical apparatus that we can put on and take off like a pair of glasses In fact the filters I am mentioning are internal mental emotional verbal and perceptual in nature Through them we process and assign a weight and meaning to every event in our lives Some things flow in others are screened out but everything is affected not just what we see but what we hear and believe Several years ago we were asked to help with the merger of two community volunteer groups who wanted to join together in order to establish an agency that would have more influence and better financing than the two separate agencies of the past Both were rural groups which had traditionally and geographically been separated by a range of mountains We worked with the two groups to help them set goals develop policy and build an organizational structure Meanwhile the young executive director who saw a successful merger as his primary responsibility was especially careful about one thing On either side of the mountain was a large town Each of the former agencies had its own board a separate staff and long standing regional ties The executive director understood that the question of where the new joint agency s headquarters would be was an important question as well as a potentially explosive one In leading the planning meetings of the two boards he carefully kept the groups focused on the long range issues and convinced them not to look at the headquarters question until the very end of the process Once the organizational structure was set by laws agreed upon and all the volunteers had actually merged then the headquarters site was decided on logically and easily as it turned out By then everyone was so committed to the organization and its goals that the headquarters question had become a relatively unimportant routine one The executive director of the merging agencies was primarily concerned about the long range good of the organization and the total community He used all his influence and persuasive powers to make that a common focus and the results were successful In Charley Kline was working as a programmer at UCLA and participating in a project at Stanford University He was asked to arrange the first computer to computer message through an ordinary telephone line After successfully connecting the two computers Kline began to type login He typed l and got the echo from Stanford confirming that the letter had been received He proceeded with o and again received the appropriate echo Then he ventured to g However that was too much for the young system to absorb and the computer crashed killing the connection after all The connection was quickly reestablished and after the UCLA and Stanford nodes were firmly in place many others joined in One of the most painful signs of the lack of readiness for the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in was the enthusiasm of children who rushed excitedly down to the beach to gather fish during the initial retreat of water Those ill fated children had no idea what the sea s strange retreat meant No one knew because nothing like that had happened in living memory except for the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean After the th century disaster experts called for a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean similar to the successful one now operating in the Pacific If such a system had been up and running in the Indian Ocean many of the thousands of lives lost in places relatively distant from the center of the earthquake might have been saved The gym teacher walked into the room and recognized that I had been fighting with Matt He sent us out to the running track He followed us with a smile on his face and said I want both of you to run the track holding each other s hands The class captain erupted into a roar of laughter and we were embarrassed beyond belief Hesitantly my enemy and I started running What had earlier been fists were now linked in a strange handshake At some point during the course of the obligatory mini marathon that both of us felt anger about I remember looking over at the large person beside me His nose was still bleeding a bit Tears filled his eyes His giant body slowed him down Suddenly it struck me that here was a person not all that different from myself I guess my unwilling partner thought the same thing because we both looked at each other and began to laugh In time we became good friends I no longer saw the big figure in the same light Instead of the dull boy who I had hated for a long time here was someone like me the human being who had internal value and worth far beyond any externals It was amazing what I had learned from being forced to run hand in hand with someone For the rest of my life I have never raised a hand against another person A group of scientists was doing research on superconductivity but reached a dead end They finally gave up putting the work aside so that they could concentrate on other activities One of the scientists on this project decided to take a break and went down to the company library While browsing through reading materials he came across an article in a scientific journal The article approached the subject of superconductivity from a completely different direction from the one they had been working on He immediately began applying it to their experiments and within months they discovered the secret to superconductivity Not long after they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics You might think iced desserts would be a fairly recent creation due to the problems of refrigeration in the past The Chinese however who had perfected ice storage using the principle of evaporation in the eighth century B C were enjoying fruit flavored ices by the time Marco Polo visited in the thirteenth century He brought the recipe back to Italy where it has been a favorite ever since The Arabs and Indians picked up the idea from the Chinese as well and named this delicious dessert sherbet But it did not have the exact form and name of ice cream yet What we call ice cream today was created in the early seventeenth century by a French chef for King Charles of England After that it was introduced and popularized in the United States by First Lady Dolly Madison A short time ago some builders working on a studio in Connecticut left a huge square of plate glass standing upright in a field A sparrow flying swiftly across the field struck the glass and was knocked out He woke and went to his club where an attendant bandaged his head What happened asked a seagull I was flying across a meadow when all of a sudden the air crystallized on me said the sparrow The seagull a hawk and an eagle all laughed heartily A crow listened gravely For fifteen years I ve flown this country said the eagle and I assure you there is no such thing as air crystallizing Water yes air no You were probably struck by a hailstone the hawk told the sparrow Or he may have had a stroke said the seagull What do you think crow Why I think maybe the air crystallized on him said the crow The large birds laughed so loudly that the sparrow became annoyed And then the sparrow bet each of them ten worms that they couldn t follow the course he had flown without encountering the hardened atmosphere They all took his bet the crow went along to watch Later the seagull the eagle and the hawk decided to fly together over the route the sparrow indicated You come too they said to the crow I I well no said the crow I don t think I will So the three large birds took off together And they hit the glass together and were all knocked out Did you know that many of the first European settlers in America lived in caves It is true These early arrivals had neither the time nor the tools to build anything better This was especially the case in New England where winters were harsh Some type of immediate shelter was needed and caves would serve this purpose These hardy colonists thus dug caves along the side of a cliff made a roof of bark supported by poles and their castles were complete As conditions improved more permanent dwellings began to emerge throughout the colonies Each section of the colonies developed its own fixed style housing dependent on the climate and the materials at hand A code is constantly under attack from codebreakers When the codebreakers have developed a new weapon that reveals a code s weakness then the code is no longer useful It either becomes extinct or evolves into a new stronger code In turn this new code survives only until the codebreakers identify its weakness and so on This is similar to the situation facing for example a strain of infectious bacteria The bacteria prevail until doctors discover an antibiotic that exposes a weakness in the bacteria and kills most of them The remaining bacteria are then forced to evolve and defeat the antibiotic and if successful they will reestablish themselves and prevail once again My name is Caroline Finch I live in Albuquerque New Mexico In the downtown area I often see homeless people begging for money all around the stoplights I used to give a lot of money to them feeling sorry for their misfortune But as time passed I became a single mom with no home a huge debt and hardly any income As a result I became very bitter and stopped giving to the people on the side of the road Eventually things started to change for me I became responsible enough to have a home a backyard for my daughter and plenty of food I saved money and started to pull myself out of debt One day we saw a homeless person with the sign Will work for food I passed by My daughter commented Mommy you used to give to those people in need I replied Honey they just use that money for alcohol or other bad things She didn t respond But when I said that it didn t feel right Three days later I was driving to pick up my daughter from school A man was standing on the corner and something deep inside me said Just help the guy So I rolled down my window and he ran over with enthusiasm He said God bless you I only need cents I reached into my ashtray and oddly enough there sat three quarters and two pennies My hair stood up when I saw this I picked them up and gave them to him He burst out with joy and tears in his eyes Wow you just made it possible for me to see my mom for Christmas Thank you so much The bus that has this great Christmas discount is leaving in minutes It was a moment I ll never forget I think that man won t forget it either but I was the one who got the best gift in life When Alexandre Gustave Eiffel designed his famous free standing foot iron tower in Paris in the late th century he did so without modern science or engineering Mathematicians though havelong suspected that an elegant logic lies behind the monument s graceful shape That conviction led engineer Patrick Weidman to search for the mathematical formula behind the tower s curve Initially frustrated Weidman s eureka moment came when he found a long overlooked memo written by Eiffel in The document gave Weidman the insights he needed to work out the mathematical formula that describes the tower Corporate social responsibility means that a corporation should be held accountable for any of its actions that affect people It implies that negative business impacts on people and society should be corrected if at all possible It may require a company to give up some profits if its social impacts are seriously harmful to some of the corporation s investors However being socially responsible does not mean that a company must abandon its primary economic mission This also doesn t suggest that socially responsible firms cannot be as profitable as other less socially responsible firms Social responsibility requires companies to balance the benefits to be gained against the costs of achieving those benefits When I was years old Dad promised to take me with him on a business trip to San Francisco I was so excited We were going to be there for two days and we planned everything Dad was going to be busy in meetings the first day so I would hang around the hotel After his meetings we planned to have our favorite Chinese food Then we d take a ride on a tourist bus and go back to our hotel room for a video and chocolate ice cream I was dying with anticipation The day finally arrived The hours dragged by as I waited at the hotel Six o clock came but Dad didn t Finally at he arrived with another man an influential businessman I remember how my heart sank as this man asked if we would like to go to a seafood restaurant with him Oh no I thought I hate fish and I ll just sit there while Dad and his friend talk I could see all my hopes and plans I had with my dad being ruined I will never forget the feeling I had when Dad said to his friend I d love to go to the restaurant with you but tonight is a special time with my daughter I could tell this man was disappointed but amazingly to me he seemed to understand Dad and I did everything we had planned on that trip I don t think any young girl ever loved her father as much as I loved mine that night If you spend lots of time outdoors you probably know that SPF is a rating for sunscreen The higher a sunscreen s Sun Protection Factor SPF the longer you can be exposed to sunlight before your skin gets burned The earth also has a sunscreen which is called ozone A band of ozone high above the earth shields the planet from the sun s harmful ultraviolet UV rays The ozone layer however is being destroyed As a result more UV rays strike the earth Exposure to harmful rays can cause skin cancer in humans destroy plants and kill ocean plankton Suppose you have a tight pair of red shoes Whenever you wear them they hurt So you want to take them off the minute you put them on This discourages you from wearing the red shoes Every time you want to wear your red suit you look at those red shoes The act of putting on the red shoes is painful however so that behavior is suppressed This is an example of negative reinforcement In the same way negative reinforcement tells your child only what will bring on pain In this case the red shoes are replaced by a feeling of being ignored or of stress resulting from unexplained punishment The negative reinforcement tells the child what not to do without indicating what he or she should do The use of negative reinforcement therefore is not a good way of bringing up children since it gives them no information about desirable behavior Because of this parents are advised to practice positive reinforcement in order to give the child guidance regarding alternative courses of action Is it possible to measure beauty Well the ancient Greeks believed that all beauty could be explained with math and used a system to find what they called the Golden Ratio They found it by drawing lines between key points of a beautiful object and making calculations They believed that all beautiful things share the same ratio This idea is still popular today An American researcher carefully measured thousands of faces and was able to produce a Universal Beauty Mask based on this Golden Ratio According to him how closely the mask fits can show how beautiful you are In July the European Union passed a law requiring all food products from GM crops to be clearly marked Many countries have stopped further planting until there are more health checks Moreover public concern is so great in some countries that food companies are ending the use of GM crops altogether So people around the world are starting to ask the question Just how safe are these new designer foods Yet in spite of the advantages mentioned above the use of GM crops is causing debates among scientists Research has discovered that GM crops were harming butterflies and also that GM food slowed growth and increased disease in rats Resistance to GM foods around the world is growing With the global population expected to rise to billion within years GM technology is giving hope to people around the world They think GM crops can offer bigger harvests better quality and less need for spraying poisons to kill insects Not surprisingly the use of GM seeds has quickly become popular among farmers More than fifty percent of all crops planted in the U S are from GM seeds including tomatoes corn and potatoes Most of us have a general rational sense of what to eat and when there is no shortage of information on the subject Yet there is often a disconnect between what we know and what we do We may have the facts but decisions also involve our feelings Many people who struggle with difficult emotions also struggle with eating problems Emotional eating is a popular term used to describe eating that is influenced by emotions both positive and negative Feelings may affect various aspects of your eating including your motivation to eat your food choices where and with whom you eat and the speed at which you eat Most overeating is prompted by feelings rather than physical hunger Individuals who struggle with obesity tend to eat in response to emotions However people who eat for emotional reasons are not necessarily overweight People of any size may try to escape an emotional experience by preoccupying themselves with eating or by obsessing over their shape and weight Ever since the first scientific opinion polls revealed that most Americans are at best poorly informed about politics analysts have asked whether citizens are equipped to play the role democracy assigns them However there is something worse than an inadequately informed public and that s a misinformed public It s one thing when citizens don t know something and realize it which has always been a problem It s another thing when citizens don t know something but think they know it which is the new problem It s the difference between ignorance and irrationality Whatever else one might conclude about self government it s at risk when citizens don t know what they re talking about Our misinformation owes partly to psychological factors including our tendency to see the world in ways that suit our desires Such factors however can explain only the misinformation that has always been with us The sharp rise in misinformation in recent years has a different source our media They are making us dumb says one observer When fact bends to fiction the predictable result is political distrust and polarization Both the budget deficit and federal debt have soared during the recent financial crisis and recession During nearly percent of federal expenditures were financed by borrowing The huge recent federal deficits have pushed the federal debt to levels not seen since the years immediately following World War II The rapid growth of baby boomer retirees in the decade immediately ahead will mean higher spending levels and larger and larger deficits for both Social Security and Medicare Moreover more than half of Americans age and older derive benefits from various transfer programs while paying little or no personal income tax All of these factors are going to make it extremely difficult to slow the growth of federal spending and keep the debt from ballooning out of control Projections indicate that the net federal debt will rise to percent of GDP by and many believe it will be even higher unless constructive action is taken soon Erikson believes that when we reach the adult years several physical social and psychological stimuli trigger a sense of generativity A central component of this attitude is the desire to care for others For the majority of people parenthood is perhaps the most obvious and convenient opportunity to fulfill this desire Erikson believes that another distinguishing feature of adulthood is the emergence of an inborn desire to teach We become aware of this desire when the event of being physically capable of reproducing is joined with the events of participating in a committed relationship the establishment of an adult pattern of living and the assumption of job responsibilities According to Erikson by becoming parents we learn that we have the need to be needed by others who depend on our knowledge protection and guidance We become entrusted to teach culturally appropriate behaviors values attitudes skills and information about the world By assuming the responsibilities of being primary caregivers to children through their long years of physical and social growth we concretely express what Erikson believes to be an inborn desire to teach Perceptions of forest use and the value of forests as standing timber vary considerably from indigenous peoples to national governments and Western scientists These differences in attitudes and values lie at the root of conflicting management strategies and stimulate protest groups such as the Chipko movement For example the cultivators of the Himalayas and Karakoram view forests as essentially a convertible resource That is under increasing population pressure and growing demands for cultivable land the conversion of forest into cultivated terraces means a much higher productivity can be extracted from the same area Compensation in the form of planting on terrace edges occurs to make up for the clearance This contrasts with the national view of the value of forests as a renewable resource with the need or desire to keep a forest cover over the land for soil conservation and with a global view of protection for biodiversity and climate change purposes irrespective of the local people s needs As a couple start to form a relationship they can be seen to develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and in particular how it is similar or different to their parents relationship The couple s initial disclosures involve them forming constructs about how much similarity there is between them and each other s families What each of them will remember is selective and coloured by their family s constructs system In turn it is likely that as they tell each other their already edited stories there is a second process of editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again interpreted within their respective family of origin s construct systems The two sets of memories the person talking about his or her family and the partner s edited version of this story go into the cooking pot of the couple s new construct system Subsequently one partner may recall a part of the other s story as a tactic in negotiations for example Harry may say to Doris that she is being bossy just like her mother Since this is probably based on what Doris has told Harry this is likely to be a very powerful tactic She may protest or attempt to rewrite this version of her story thereby possibly adding further material that Harry could use in this way These exchanges of stories need not always be employed in such malevolent ways These reconstructed memories can become very powerful to a point where each partner may become confused even about the simple factual details of what actually did happen in their past Over the last week Jason had been feeling worried about his daughter Sally For two months now Sally had been absorbed perhaps even excessively in studying birds He was afraid she might begin to ignore her schoolwork While shopping Jason was glad to run into his old friend Jennifer a bird expert working at the local university Maybe she could help ease his concern Upon hearing about Sally s interest Jennifer invited them both to visit her office to see just how deep Sally s fascination was Two days later Jason and Sally visited Jennifer s office Sally was delighted by the books about birds and she joyfully looked at the beautiful pictures in them It was while Jason and Jennifer were talking that Sally suddenly shouted Oh I ve seen this bird Impossible replied Jennifer not believing it This book shows rare birds You can t see any of them around here But she insisted I spotted a pair of them in their nest in a huge oak tree nearby Jennifer walked up to Sally and took a close look at the page She calmly said That s the black robin of Chathas Island It s one of the rarest birds Sally You couldn t have seen it in this town Yet Sally persisted In that case can you show me the nest asked Jennifer Yes I can right now if you want answered Sally full of confidence Jennifer put on her coat pulled out a pair of binoculars and stepped out Sally and Jason followed Approaching the tree Sally shouted excitedly There that s the nest Jennifer looked up to see a small cup shaped nest within a fork of the branches Quickly she took out her binoculars and peered where Sally pointed In the fading evening light she found the two rare black birds in their nest See didn t I tell you exclaimed Sally Looking at her in joyful surprise both Jason and Jennifer were proud of Sally They now recognized her extraordinary gift and passion as a bird watcher One of the hallmarks of evaluating the quality of a black tea is by assessing how tightly the leaves are rolled Generally higher graded teas are teas with leaves that are tightly and uniformly rolled Lower graded teas on the other hand are teas with leaves that are loosely and inconsistently rolled With that said the tightness of the roll has more to do with the steepability of a leaf than it does with the taste of a tea Therefore one should not evaluate the tea s drinkability or taste merely because its leaves are not tightly rolled It is common to find that people prefer the taste of looser rolled black teas over more expensive or more highly graded black teas that have been tightly rolled It has been said that eye movements are windows into the mind because where people look reveals what environmental information they are attending to However there is more to attention than just moving the eyes to look at objects We can pay attention to things that are not directly in our line of vision as evidenced by the basketball player who dribbles down court while paying attention to a teammate off to the side just before she throws a perfect pass without looking We can also look directly at something without paying attention to it You may have had this experience if you have been reading a book and then suddenly become aware that although you were moving your eyes across the page and reading the words you had no idea what you had just read Even though you were looking at the words you apparently were not paying attention There is a mental aspect of attention that involves processing that can occur independently of eye movements Today the term artist is used to refer to a broad range of creative individuals across the globe from both past and present This rather general usage erroneously suggests that the concept or word artist existed in original contexts In contrast to the diversity it is applied to the meaning of this term continues to be mostly based on Western views and values Since the fifteenth century this tradition has been concerned with recognizing individual achievements Inventions ideas and discoveries have been credited to the persons who originated them This view is also at the core of the definition of an artist Artists are perceived to establish a strong bond with their art to the point of combining into one entity Art history has reinforced this oneness A painting by Pablo Picasso is called a Picasso This union between artists and their work has determined the essential qualities of an artist originality authorship and authenticity The one area in which the Internet could be considered an aid to thinking is the rapid acquisition of new information But this is more fictional than real Yes the simple act of typing a few words into a search engine will virtually instantaneously produce links related to the topic at hand But the examination of the accuracy of information obtained in this manner is not a simple matter What one often gets is no more than abstract summaries of lengthy articles As a consequence I suspect that the number of downloads of any given scientific paper has little relevance to the number of times the entire article has been read from beginning to end My advice is that if you want to do some serious thinking then you d better disconnect the Internet phone and television set and try spending twenty four hours in absolute solitude There are many instances of rapid work on the part of the great composers and their facility and quickness of composition causes great wonder and admiration But our admiration is often misdirected When we hear of some of the speedy writing of great works by Mozart or Mendelssohn we might think that this speed was of the composing power as well as of pen but in fact such was seldom the case These great musicians generally did their composition mentally without reference to pen or piano and simply postponed the unpleasant manual labor of committing their music to paper until it became absolutely necessary Then they got credit for incredible rapidity of composition But it is no light matter to quickly and correctly pen a long and complicated composition One has only to copy a piece of music or to try to put into notes some piece of music previously memorized to realize this The weakness of local networks lies in their self containment for they lack input as well as outreach In a classic study of urban politics Herbert Gans found that neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city It was for this reason that Gans referred to them as urban villagers As the opposite of local networks cosmopolitan networks offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and sustain members But members benefit from a constant flow of new information and from the great reach of their influence even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in strength Local networks tend to be small In contrast cosmopolitan networks can be huge Thus while the urban villagers lacked ties even to their local city government cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the White House An important lesson to remember is that we should try to see the positives in life even while we are stuck in the middle of trouble Riccardo who was named after his father an immigrant from Mexico learned this lesson at a young age Although the family called him Ricky his father had his own nickname for him Good for Nothing Why did the elder Riccardo call him that Because Ricky hated fishing His father saw this very negatively because he was a fisherman He loved the fishing business So did all of his sons except for Good for Nothing Ricky The boy did not like being on the boat and the smell of fish made him sick Instead Ricky who was not afraid of hard work delivered newspapers shined shoes worked in the office and even repaired nets His income went to the family Even so his father was strongly dissatisfied with him and still always said that he was good for nothing Since these jobs were not fishing his father saw no value in them Young Ricky hated fishing Everything would be fine if it were not fishing he thought to himself Soon Ricky began to follow his older brother who used to play sandlot ball For Ricky playing baseball with him was a way to forget his hardship Fortunately Ricky was very good at it and was treated like a hero among his playmates When Ricky was sixteen he decided to drop out of school to become a baseball player And by the time he was through with baseball he had become a legend The nation came to know Ricky as the most complete player of his generation and he was voted into the Hall of Fame And his father the elder Riccardo what did he think about it Though he had wanted all of his sons to join the family business he was finally proud of Ricky and respected his accomplishments Ricky held onto hope in one of the most difficult moments of his life and achieved greatness The pull effect of a destination can be positively influenced by the introduction and reinforcement of pro tourism policies that make a destination more accessible Governments for example can and often do employ awareness campaigns among the resident population to promote a welcoming attitude towards visitors in order to foster a positive market image However because such campaigns depend on widespread social engineering and because their effects can be counteracted by random acts of violence positive outcomes cannot be guaranteed Furthermore it is the behaviour of some tourists and the structure and development of tourism itself that often generate negative attitudes within the host community This implies that major structural changes to tourism itself rather than awareness campaigns may be required to foster a welcoming attitude Psychologists Dember and Earl suggested that the motivation for exploration had its roots in a curiosity drive They suggested that curiosity is stimulated by novelty and argued that novelty is in the eye of the beholder We could have seen something many times before but as the result of having new skills or competence we discover new or different aspects of that object This is very important for understanding why people will often return to explore things that they explored before or do things they have done before In our daily lives for example we might decide to listen to a piece of music that we have listened to many times By returning to that music with a new or fresh perspective perhaps as a result of listening to other music we find something new and interesting One reason that people can play a card game such as bridge over and over is that no matter how many times you have played the game it will be different in some way The hunters armed only with primitive weapons were no real match for an angry mammoth Many were probably killed or severely injured in the close encounters that were necessary to slay one of these gigantic animals But the rewards were great when one was brought down A single mammoth could feed clothe and supply a band for a long time The hunters had followed the mammoths and other large animals eastward from Asia across what is now the Bering Sea Some of them may have traveled by small boat along the coast but many walked Twenty thousand years ago at the height of the last glacial period sea level was so low that dry land joined what are now separate continents Slowly imperceptibly and probably unconsciously hunters had moved across the land bridge and become the first immigrants to the new land Without the ice age North America might have remained unpopulated for thousands of years more Researchers have reported various nonverbal features of sarcasm Most disagree as to whether nonverbal cues are essential to the perception of sarcasm or the emotion that prompts it Even so research confirms the finding that nonverbal cues are more credible than verbal cues especially when verbal and nonverbal cues conflict Also nonverbal cues are better indicators of speaker intent As the nature of sarcasm implies a contradiction between intent and message nonverbal cues may leak and reveal the speaker s true mood as they do in deception Ostensibly sarcasm is the opposite of deception in that a sarcastic speaker typically intends the receiver to recognize the sarcastic intent whereas in deception the speaker typically intends that the receiver not recognize the deceptive intent Thus when communicators are attempting to determine if a speaker is sarcastic they compare the verbal and nonverbal message and if the two are in opposition communicators may conclude that the speaker is being sarcastic Our total set of values and their relative importance to us constitute our value system The way that we behave in a given situation is often influenced by how important one value is to us relative to others For instance deciding whether to spend Saturday afternoon relaxing with your family or exercising will be determined by the relative importance that you place on family versus health You feel value conflict when you do something that is consistent with one value but inconsistent with another equally important value This dynamic can be illustrated with the example of parents who place equal value on convenience and concern for the environment They may experience value conflict if they buy disposable diapers for their babies Consumers facing such decisions consider not only the product s immediate consumption outcomes but also the product s general effect on society including how the manufacturer behaves e g toward the environment In science one experiment whether it succeeds or fails is logically followed by another in a theoretically infinite progression According to the underlying myth of modern science this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future In the arts by contrast no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better Given the methodologies of science the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works nobody ever would have written them If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a group of computers and says Any of those are good and then walks away there is a good chance you will walk away too and with good reason Why You were never asked what you were seeking how much you could spend or if the computer would be used for business or pleasure or your child s homework assignments In brief the salesperson never considered or asked about your needs and preferences Just as it would come as no surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a potential customer s needs was soon out of a job the same holds true for writers who ignore their readers That is the reader is the writer s customer and one whose business or approval is one we need to seek The more you know about your reader the greater the chances you will meet his or her needs and expectations According to one traditional definition aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with beauty especially beauty in the arts Examining the pleasing features of the Mona Lisa or a snow capped mountain for example would come under aesthetics That definition seems too narrow however since works of art and natural objects may interest us in other ways than by being beautiful Instead of evoking admiration of beauty artists may evoke puzzlement shock and even disgust Consider Picasso s Guernica a huge ft ft painting in black white and grey that he made in response to the slaughter of Spanish civilians by German and Italian warplanes during the Spanish Civil War Images of a cruel war dominate the canvas This work is widely admired but not for being beautiful So a better definition of aesthetics would be that it is the branch of philosophy that deals with the ways things please people in being experienced A year old doing addition problems by counting on makes the same error repeatedly with responses such as and The teacher asks the pupil to show how these answers were obtained and notices that in doing the addition of to the pupil counts seven eight nine while turning up three fingers in turn The pupil is counting on from but incorrectly starting at The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when doing addition problems by counting on along a number line Analysis of the errors leads the teacher to modify the teaching of these procedures using the language seven and three more rather than seven count on three This is immediately effective So the teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in subsequent oral work with the whole class Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological space while consuming the resources of that space This question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans ever growing carbon footprints Some argue that we are already at a breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth s finite carrying capacity However it s possible that innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth s capacity We are already seeing this as the world economies are increasingly looking at green renewable industries like solar and hydrogen energy Still many believe we will eventually reach a point at which conflict with the finite nature of resources is inevitable That means survival could ultimately depend on getting the human population below its carrying capacity Otherwise without population control the demand for resources will eventually exceed an ecosystem s ability to provide it Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely objectively with no possible subjective influence on the outcome Unfortunately few if any scientists are truly objective as they have often decided long before the experiment is begun what they would like the result to be This means that very often bias is unintentionally introduced into the experiment the experimental procedure or the interpretation of results It is all too easy to justify to yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your expectations should be ignored and why one which provides the results you hoped for is the right one This can be partly avoided by conducting experiments blinded and by asking others to check your data or repeat experiments Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of their ecosystem than others Such species called keystone species are vital in determining the nature and structure of the entire ecosystem The fact that other species depend on or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed when the keystone species is removed It is in this sense that we should draw attention to fig trees Different species of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain forests Although figs collectively produce a continuous crop of fruits fruit eating monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large quantities of figs in their diets During the time of year when other fruits are less plentiful however fig trees become important in sustaining fruit eating vertebrates Should the fig trees disappear most of the fruit eating vertebrates would be eliminated Protecting fig trees in such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that monkeys birds bats and other vertebrates will survive True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of context The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is a telling example At the zoo visitors may witness a great beast pacing behind the bars of its cage They may observe and admire the creature its amazing bone structure and its magnificent coat However no matter how long visitors spend in front of that cage they will never truly understand the beast True understanding can only come from seeing the creature in its natural surroundings and in turn the ways in which its presence affects its environment What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true of science To fully understand science it must be considered within the society in which it functions Science is not conducted in a vacuum It is embedded within a social fabric and just as a flesh and blood beast influences and is influenced by its environment so too do science and society mutually influence one another Society through ethical and economic constraints exerts a powerful influence on what science accomplishes At the same time the results of science have profound and sometimes unexpected impacts on every human being on earth Therefore to make sense of science related issues it is critical to recognize the bidirectional relationship between science and society Peter Anderson was exhausted when he finally opened the front door of his apartment He teaches first graders which means he lives in a world of riddles birthday cakes and pointless stories His world is dominated by year olds Throwing himself with his leather bag on the long comfortable sofa he closed his eyes and reviewed the events of the day Today was especially busy and wearying and Anderson wondered whether he was really suitable for teaching He was stressed as kids constantly sought his attention At snack time Emily wanted him to open her milk carton so he did As she was drinking Scott spilled his milk and Anderson had to help him clean it up Then Jenny Andrew Mark and Kids never ceased However he still loved them That s also what he had said in the interview for the position It was held in a seminar room where Anderson met the principal for the first time three years ago The principal asked why he chose to work with young children He answered that he loved helping children learn to write their names for the first time finding someone a new friend and sharing in the joy of reading But as time passed his commitment and passion seemed to fade gradually He recalled his strong conviction during the interview That s why Anderson took the job in the first place even though some of his friends attempted to persuade him to be a lawyer or businessman He shook his head and opened his eyes Ashe struggled to get up he saw something fall from his bag It was a birthday card from his students decorated with all kinds of odd shaped but colorful hearts and scribbled names Dear Mr Anderson happy birthday to you It s our surprise gift for you We love you Anderson could not help but smile He already felt much better We ve all heard the phrase the family that plays together stays together The wisdom in this phrase is that social play builds ties between people that are lasting and consequential This wisdom holds outside the human family circle as well For example when one ground squirrel sees a predator in the distance it will sound an alarm call that alerts other squirrels to run for cover It s a risky move In crying out the danger spotting squirrel draws attention to itself which may well attract the predator Scientists used to think that animals would risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they shared common genes New evidence suggests however that squirrels also sound alarm calls for former playmates not genetically related These squirrels developed a social resource while playing and these buddies will put their lives on the line to save their playmates Self fulfilling prophecies can have a positive side We know that students introduced to their teachers as intellectual bloomers often do better on achievement tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive introduction In a study of army tank crews one set of tank commanders was told that some members of their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others were only average In reality the crew members had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups were equal in ability The commanders later reported that the so called exceptional crew members performed better than the average ones The study also revealed the commanders had given more attention and praise to the crew members for whom they had the higher expectations The self fulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward others at work Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked crosswalks But as some researchers found that does not necessarily make things safer When they compared the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks on roads with considerable traffic volumes they found that people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways more often waited more often for gaps in traffic and crossed the road more quickly Researchers suspect that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks Not kBut neither are aware of this fact when it comes to unmarked crosswalks nowing traffic safety laws it turns out is actually a good thing for pedestrians Because they do not know whether cars are supposed to stop they act more cautiously Marked crosswalks by contrast may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own safety Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits the mind by catching the reader s attention and triggering moments of self reflection The brain activity of volunteers was monitored as they read classical works These same texts were then translated into more straightforward modern language and again the readers brains were monitored as they read the words Scans showed that the more challenging prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the readers encountered unusual words surprising phrases or difficult sentence structures This lighting up lasts long enough to shift the brain into a higher gear encouraging further reading The research also found that reading the more challenging version of poetry in particular increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain helping the readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they have read The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self help books Organisms must compete for resources not only with members of their own species but with members of other species When two species use the same resource and the resource is scarce the species must compete just as if they were members of the same population One of the two species usually turns out to be better at the competition If two species eat exactly the same food for example one of the two will be better at catching it Unless something interferes the inferior competitor loses out and the competitively superior species takes over When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it it is called competitive exclusion Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented from excluding poorer competitors Periodic disturbances such as severe storms battering by drifting logs or underwater landslides can reduce the population of a dominant competitor and give other species a chance Furthermore which species is competitively superior sometimes depends on the conditions On rocky shores in tropical Hong Kong for example foliose leaf like algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively cool winter In the summer heat these forms die out and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from excluding the other and there is a shifting balance between the competing species Jim Nelson a junior at Manti High School was an outstanding athlete He had just made the school basketball team one of the best in the state But on October most of his athletic future was suddenly taken away from him Jim was riding his bicycle at night to visit his friend The road was very steep in some places It was very dark and difficult to see As he came around a sloping curve on his bicycle Jim hit a car parked on the side of the road He ended up in the hospital Besides bad cuts on his head he broke his right arm and was in a cast for two months Jim s doctor gave him a series of tests The doctor concluded that he had suffered nerve damage and that he might never regain the full use of his right arm Because of his injury Jim wasn t able to play on the basketball team during the rest of that year but the coach did make him equipment manager so that he could come and practice All summer long in each and every night he practiced making left handed baskets When the next season arrived Jim was ready to try out for the team and he made it again Jim never became a starter but he was always the first substitute to go in the game Jim got a chance to play in the last seconds of the championship game when a starting player sprained his ankle With seconds left Jim balanced the ball in his left hand and took the shot The crowd was deathly quiet until swish He made the three point shot left handed Jim won not only the game but also the hearts of his teammates for proving that with determination no obstacle is too great B Most of the words we use and the meanings we think about are a combination of simpler ideas Consider a chair Before you can have an idea of a chair you need to understand that there exist in the world certain functional objects Some of these objects support human activity in this case sitting Some of them are specialized for sitting at certain high places like bar stools If you learned about a culture in which a certain type of chair was used only for the purpose of sitting while waiting for a bus you might think this is odd but would have no difficulty understanding it The combination of the concepts chair and waiting for bus allows you to create the new complex concept chair used while waiting for bus But the basic concept of chair is built out of the simpler ideas that we take for granted object furniture sitting By changing the focus or context of a task we can get renewed energy even when we feel that we are completely out of energy To demonstrate this a psychologist asked people to take part in what she called semi free tasks The tasks included drawing repeatedly writing ababababababab or reading a short poem The participants were asked to do these tasks until they felt exhausted The experimenter then changed the context so that the participants had to do a subtly different task Those drawing were asked to redraw their last picture to demonstrate how quickly they could draw Those writing abab were asked to sign their name and address In this new context their fatigue disappeared This phenomenon of creating a second wind can be seen in action at airports where security officers rotate around different stations to stop routine induced fatigue from settling in During the s researchers began to suggest that human vulnerability to hazards rather than the hazards themselves was central to understanding the importance of hazards particularly when considering that a city is a geographical focus for large populations Further it was reported that human and material losses from disasters had increased during the th century This happened at a time when cities in the developing world were growing at unprecedented rates bringing together large populations of low income urban residents often on hazardous spontaneous settlements which made them far more vulnerable to natural and human induced hazards It is precisely this issue of vulnerability on which a number of social scientists focused arguing that although floods landslides and earthquakes are natural processes the disasters that can be associated with them are not a result of natural processes but of human vulnerability If you don t get the kind of information failure provides you ll end up with unrealistic expectations for yourself explains a psychologist You could wind up in a position where failure which has gathered under cover of darkness reveals itself all at once We should hope then for exposure to failure early and often The sociologist Glen Elder proposed that there is a sensitive period for growth late teens through early s during which failures are most beneficial Such a pattern seems to promote the trait sometimes called equanimity We learn that trauma is survivable so we don t plunge too deeply following setbacks Nor conversely do we soar too high on our successes Some businesses in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street make a point of hiring ex pro athletes to their staffs It s not just that their high profile draws business It s because athletes are good at recovering from their failures We needed people who could perform and not get emotionally attached to losses a Chicago oil trader told the New York Times explaining why the firm likes athletes on the trading floor particularly in ugly economic times like these The image is of a rider easy in the saddle Nothing can so surprise her either for good or ill that she ll be knocked off One way to help keep life s slings and arrows from knocking you off course is to ensure your life is multidimensional says Stephen Berglas a California psychologist and personal coach That way a setback in any one area won t mean in your mind that you re a failure categorically Call it spreading your risk across your emotional portfolio or adding another leg to the furniture for balance says Berglas To be creative problem solvers people must learn to approach complexity with a certain naive simplicity And by letting their thinking become more free they can improve their chances of discovering new unencumbered perceptions of old problems or entirely new creations For this they can mentally play with the ideas in a childlike manner Here is an example story In a small Moravian village at the time of the old Austrian empire an inspector from the Ministry of Education arrived one day to visit the schoolroom It was part of his duty to make such periodic inspections of the schools At the end of the hour after he had observed the class he stood up and said I am glad to see that you children are doing well in your studies I am satisfied with your progress Therefore before I go there is one question I would like to ask How many hairs does a horse have Very quickly one little nine year old boy raised his hand to the astonishment of the teacher and the visitor He stood up and said The horse has hairs The inspector wonderingly asked And how do you know that this is the right number The boy replied If you do not believe me you could count them yourself The inspector broke into loud laughter thoroughly enjoying the boy s remark As the teacher escorted him along the aisle to the door still laughing heartily he said What an amusing story I must tell this story to my colleagues when I return to Vienna I can already see how they will take it they enjoy nothing better than a good joke And with that he took his leave It was a year later and the inspector was back again at the village school for his annual visit As the teacher was walking along the aisle with him to the door he stopped and said By the way Mr Inspector how did your colleagues like the story of the horse and the number of his hairs The inspector slapped the teacher on the back Oh yes he said you know I was really very anxious to tell that story and a fine story it was but you see I wasn t able for the life of me to remember the number of hairs A Power walking is a type of exercise that nearly anyone can do Many people enjoy this form of exercise because it can be done outdoors in fresh air where the scenery can be changed by altering the course of the walk Alternatively the exercise may be done indoors in a climate controlled environment on a treadmill People should start with a short distance on flat ground and gradually increase the distance and intensity While power walking people should wear shoes with a good arch support to avoid injury and wear clothes appropriate for the climate In Martin Handford a young British commercial artist who specialized in drawing cartoon scenes for clients had the idea of publishing his illustrations in book form His idea was to depict humorous crowd scenes in various locations including a beach a train station and a country fair To create a unifying theme for the many crowd scenes he invented a character of a backpacking tourist who would appear in each location In the original British editions of the book the character s name was Wally He went on to publish seven more Where s Wally books create a television show and license several video games Although the fad for his character declined in the late s there is still occasional talk of a Wally movie Wally is licensed in at least countries where he looks pretty much the same but often goes by different names Most of the words we use and the meanings we think about are a combination of simpler ideas Consider a chair Before you can have an idea of a chair you need to understand that there exist in the world certain functional objects Some of these objects support human activity in this case sitting Some of them

interactions with others are important factors in our emotional health People who have developed a high degree of communication skills are more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in their personal relationships than non communicators Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes from our close relationships which are the main source of our emotional health Close relationships develop when two people can exchange emotional messages easily and effectively Whether we develop effective communication skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on how we learn to communicate For example interaction between parents and their children is often important in determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of interaction Good parents listen to their children and allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness Children raised in households that foster communication find it easier to talk to others about their disappointments fears frustrations and other emotions later in life Such individuals find that they ultimately have better emotional health The school orchestra was practicing in the auditorium and Mr Grey was clapping his hands to mark the rhythm when he heard the town emergency siren Stop Everyone he shouted Then he ran to the door and pushed it open But a burst of wind slammed the door right back and it hit him hard He fell down and didn t move Janet was the oldest kid And she knew instantly This was a tornado Kids were shocked to see Mr Grey fall down and they began screaming Nikki put her mouth next to Janet s ear and yelled We need help Janet was scared too but she fought the fear Janet pulled Nikki and ran over to the grand piano She grabbed the whistle out of her bag and blew it hard three times Every kid on the stage turned to look at Janet In three seconds all kids were gathered around her Looking at the kids around her Janet yelled as loudly as she could Rick and Matt get Mr Grey on that cart and roll him over here Everyone else grab the music stands and bring them next to the piano Hurry When everyone came back Janet asked five of them to follow They ran to where the curtain hung along the wall of the stage Janet grabbed the edge of the curtain and screamed Everyone grab hold and pull When the curtain fell they pulled it over the tops of the music stands and the grand piano Then she motioned everyone to get under the curtain The wind noise rose again but Janet was now safely hidden inside the piano and curtain fort with the rest of the orchestra Relieved they thanked one another and felt oneness in their hearts Economic distance relates to the time and cost involved in traveling from the origin to the destination area and back The higher the economic distance the higher the resistance for that destination and consequently the lower the demand It follows conversely that between any origin and destination point if the travel time or travel cost can be reduced demand will increase Many excellent examples of this are available such as the introduction of the jet plane in and the introduction of the wide bodied jets in the late s Jet planes first cut travel time between California and Hawaii for example from twelve hours to five hours and demand grew dramatically A similar surge in demand was experienced with the introduction of the wide bodied planes for transatlantic flights The introduction of these planes cut the travel cost by almost percent between the United States and most countries on the European continent A former resident of Canton Ohio was trying to describe her image of the city to her classmates She found they had no image of this mid sized city She described Canton as a city with major manufacturing facilities and a downtown revitalization program Her explanation moved the city from the position of no image to that of a negative image The class concluded that Canton is a typical boring industrialized city Then she suddenly recalled an experience I remember hearing from a teacher that during World War II Canton was a major U S target of the Germans Imagine right after the cities of Chicago New York and Los Angeles appears the name of Canton That fact suddenly crystallized the concept of Canton If Canton is destroyed the nation might fall That s an image that gave meaning and fullness to what it meant to live in Canton Studying history is not about memorizing what we have been told it requires us to investigate the past Like a detective we start with the easy known pieces of information We then shuffle the pieces around to see how they fit together Once all the pieces fit we have the full picture As we put the pieces together we challenge ourselves to think of other ways to describe what we know For example if someone told you that Chinese Emperor Qin Shihuang was a cruel ruler would you simply accept this as the truth Or would you ask questions about the statement and look for information or evidence to support it You have to go further to ask questions such as Why was he cruel and What were the results of his rule Hence studying history trains us not to accept everything we read or hear as the truth Instead it trains us to use our critical thinking skills to get the full picture of the past When you hear the word science what s the first thing that comes to mind It s probably an image of a laboratory filled with glassware and sophisticated equipment The person doing the science is wearing a white lab coat and probably looks rather serious while engaged in some type of experiment While there are many places where this traditional view of a scientist still holds true labs aren t the only place where science is at work Science can also be found at a construction site on a basketball court and at a concert The truth is that science is happening all around us It s at work in the kitchen when cooking meals and we can even use it when painting pictures Architects use science when designing buildings and science also explains why your favorite baseball player can hit a home run Many of us believe that amnesia or sudden memory loss results in the inability to recall one s name and identity This belief may reflect the way amnesia is usually portrayed in movies television and literature For example when we meet Matt Damon s character in the movie The Bourne Identity we learn that he has no memory for who he is why he has the skills he does or where he is from He spends much of the movie trying to answer these questions However the inability to remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in reality Amnesia most often results from a brain injury that leaves the victim unable to form new memories but with most memories of the past intact Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days which you would think is a good thing But the very reversibility of our romantic commitments has only worsened our problem because that also undermines our satisfaction with our choices To see this you only need to look at a study of a group of college students in a photography class The students made a print of their two best photographs They were then told that they could choose one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file as an example of their work Then the teacher added a twist One group was told that their choice was final Whatever they chose they could not change their minds later The other group was told that they could switch photographs if they changed their minds In a survey taken later students who were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less than the other students Why this paradoxical result According to one researcher the brain has a kind of built in defense system that works to make us satisfied with choices that cannot be undone Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change our minds it appears that we are happier with our choices if we think they can t be changed which means we would be better off if we made romantic commitments more permanent and more difficult to break rather than less Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes visited her house after school Her mother was stern and meticulous about house cleaning My mother on the other hand did not care as much about a messy house She had sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the laundry to pile up In the midst of her chores my mother spent time reading This was her time away from endless hours of child care and housework Unironed school blouses and a dirty kitchen might make her feel guilty but her reading never did One day as I played in Maureen s clean house her mom fixed me with her cool gray eyes and said Your mother s nice but she reads too much I was stunned The next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of sunlight I studied her in the doorway and decided her apron could use a washing Shame flushed through me Reading was the cause pleasure reading in broad daylight Silently I made vows that would keep me from sharing my mother s fate I tried my best not to follow in her footsteps but I didn t know that it was already too late for me The way I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I was already like my mother The years passed in a blur of covertly turned pages until I was a grown up schoolteacher with a husband and children of my own I struggled mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen daylight My only guiltless reading occurred at night when the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids were in bed I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as well Off I d go to work each day passing on the gift of reading to my students I d watch as they discovered they could read and make sense of the letters and the words on a page All over the world there was agreement that this was important as important as eating or thinking or working And then one day I finally understood what she had tried to show us that reading was housework of the very best kind One reason why the definitions of words have changed over time is simply because of their misuse There are a growing number of examples where the incorrect meaning of relatively commonplace language has become more widespread than the original intention or definition The word peruse is one of them Most people think that to peruse something means to scan or skim it quickly without paying much attention In fact this is the exact opposite of what peruse really means to study or read something carefully in detail But the word has been misused so often by so many people that this second sense of it the exact opposite of what it actually means has finally been accepted as a secondary definition and as far as most people know it is the only definition Now imagine that an angry customer sent you a letter about the service he received in one of your stores If your reply is that you perused his letter he is likely to get even more angry than he was before Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that the absence of any effective form of refrigeration was critical to our early moral development Let s say that you re an early humanoid hunting and gathering on the African savannah and you strike it lucky You come across a huge beast and you manage to kill it It yields far more meat than anyone involved in the hunt or their families can possibly consume How do you get the most benefit of your excess meat without a fridge or anywhere to store it The smartest of our deep ancestors would have stored their excess meat in the bodies and minds of others not just their own kin Provided those benefiting from your gift could possibly repay your generosity in the future that was the best thing you could do with excess meat Groups of early humans who developed stable relationships and practiced this sort of mutual altruism were in a better position to prosper and multiply A bumper sticker reading Don t Believe Everything You Think is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in Greene s office It represents the underlying message of the book he is writing An analogy carried throughout the book compares the moral brain to a camera with automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or an indoor portrait or a close up of a flower and manual settings for unusual conditions or when we want a nonstandard artistic effect Greene believes emotions and intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while reasoning is the manual mode We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we could not function But they are not always trustworthy moral indicators since they were set to handle problems deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for the newer complexities of the modern world We need to rely on our manual settings the reasoning sections of our brain for more complex or novel situations Greene says I grew up in a small town in northern California between wide open ranchland and dark forests feeling at home in two places the wild land and books I read constantly hungrily and without direction collecting a strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the world I longed for a world away from what I knew and outrageously outside my means One morning I came across a catalog for a college preparatory school called Billups Academy It had a summer program and offered scholarships for high school students to deepen and extend their intellectual aesthetic and moral interests I applied for and won a scholarship Billups wasn t just another school it was another world I was used to big skies wild water snakes and horses and solitude What waited for me in this new world was tree lined avenues brick buildings with white pillars and a wood paneled library Unlike back at home in the new school I was no longer the smartest kid in the classroom I wasn t the most talented or the least Before going to Billups one of my dreams was to become a photographer That dream came to an abrupt halt in a photography class There was no denying in the other students pictures that they were far more talented than I was I became severely depressed as one dream after another faded from me Then on the last night of the summer program it hit me I had been blind to a lesson that was staring at me in the face The important lesson I learned at Billups the world was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be was a little painful It meant I was a lot smaller than I d realized I went on to attend a state university and I began to write about my disappearing dreams and new dreams about wishing and disappointment and feeling small One day a professor there took hold of me and said You re a writer Until then I hadn t really known I had to figure out who I was not going to be before I could get on to who I was The lesson from Billups lay below the surface but when I began to write it rose like flowers and bloomed into words and stories and books and me The McDonald s restaurants that are located across the United States and increasingly the world have a significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick hamburgers milk shakes and salads As sociologist George Ritzer says our everyday lives are being McDonaldized The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to the robotlike assembly of food This term refers to the standardization of everyday life a process that is transforming our lives Want to do some shopping Shopping malls offer one stop shopping in controlled environments Planning a trip Travel agencies offer package tours They will transport middle class Americans to ten European capitals in fourteen days All visitors experience the same hotels restaurants and other scheduled sites Efficiency brings dependability You can expect your burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them in Los Angeles or Beijing Although efficiency also lowers prices it does come at a cost Predictability washes away spontaneity changing the quality of our lives It produces a sameness a bland version of what used to be unique experiences In my own travels for example had I taken packaged tours I never would have had the eye opening experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of human diversity For good or bad our lives are being McDonaldized and the predictability of packaged settings seems to be our social destiny Our coming prepackaged society will be efficient of course But it also means that we will be trapped in the iron cage of bureaucracy just as Weber warned would happen Even worse than reaching a conclusion with just a little evidence is the fallacy of reaching a conclusion without any evidence at all Sometimes people mistake a separate event for a cause and effect relationship They see that A happened before B so they mistakenly assume that A caused B This is an error known in logic as a post hoc fallacy For example suppose you see a man in a black jacket hurry into a bank You notice that he is nervously carrying his briefcase and a few moments later you hear a siren You therefore leap to the conclusion that the man in the black jacket has robbed the bank However such a leap tends to land far from the truth of the matter You have absolutely no evidence only a suspicion based on coincidence This is a post hoc fallacy Hopi religion features a ritual calendar that includes a large number of annually required ceremonies In most cases each ceremony is owned by the members of a certain clan Every clan represented in a village has a clanhouse in which the masks and other sacred items used in the ceremonies are kept when not in use The clanhouse usually consists of a room adjoining the dwelling of the senior female member of the clan This woman is in charge of storing ritual equipment and of seeing to it that they are treated with the proper respect There is also a male head of each clan whose duties likewise are partly religious because he is in charge of the performance of ceremonies owned by his clan A male clan head passes his position down to either his younger brother or his sister s son In this way culturally important ritual knowledge is kept within the clan The information processing model emphasizes rational analysis for solving problems with an emphasis on techniques for quickly arriving at a solution Culturally this orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which are normally valued by contemporary Western societies For example Westerners tend to admire someone who is independent and quick thinking But these characteristics are not universally valued Agricultural African societies for example valued looking at the problem in the context of the whole society noting its impact on various features of life In most situations speed in arriving at a solution was not a vital issue This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in Canada These groups historically lived in wilderness areas and faced many hardships in these circumstances they would rarely get a second chance at solving problems Consequently these Native people value taking time to reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible solutions before any action is taken The other day an acquaintance of mine a sociable and charming man told me he had found himself unexpectedly alone in New York for an hour or two between appointments He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the empty time looking at things by himself For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone What had he been afraid of I asked myself That suddenly alone he would discover that he bored himself or that there was quite simply no self there to meet But having taken the first step into this new world he is now about to begin a new adventure he is about to be launched into his own inner space space as immense unexplored and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut His every perception will come to him with a new freshness and for a time seem startlingly original For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes for a moment or two something of a genius With another human being present vision becomes double vision inevitably We are busy wondering what does my companion see or think of this and what do I think of it The original impact gets lost Music I heard with you was more than music Exactly And therefore music itself can only be heard alone Solitude is the salt of personhood It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience My grandmother s kitchen was overflowing with food She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was in use Although she died before I was born I was raised by her eldest daughter to do this same thing Absentminded as I am I often find I have accumulated two or even three extras of anything in my house But this abundance did not mean that things were to be wasted Everything was always used to the full Even the tea bags were used twice There is a family story told about my grandmother s refrigerator Her refrigerator was always full to the very edges and every shelf was put to use Occasionally when someone usually a child opened it without sufficient caution an egg would fall out and break on the kitchen floor My grandmother s response was always the same She would look at the broken egg with satisfaction Aha she would say today we have a sponge cake Befriending life is not always about having things your own way Life is impermanent and full of broken eggs But what is true of eggs is even more true of pain and loss and suffering Certain things are too important to be wasted When I was sixteen just after the doctor came and informed me that I had a disease that no one knew how to cure my mother had reminded me of this I had turned toward her in shock but she did not cuddle or soothe Instead she reached out and took me by the hand We will make a sponge cake she told me firmly It has taken many years to find the recipe the one that is my own but I knew in that moment that this was what I needed to do A man was diagnosed with a terminal illness and given six months to live In his last few days he said that he had done more in the past months than in his entire life Remember that life has a deadline we just do not know when it is So let s get one We are going to do some calculations to find out how much longer you have to live Start with the number the average life expectancy Now subtract your current age Multiply that number by What you have is the number of days that you have left to live Write this number down and every morning cross it out and write the new number which is one day less This decreasing number is a constant reminder to motivate you to take action to live your life today You trade each day of your life for what you do in that day Make a good trade Consider the following experiment with a strong and a weak pig Two pigs are kept in a box with a lever at one end and a food dispenser at the other When the lever is pushed food appears at the dispenser If the weak pig pushes the lever the strong pig waits by the dispenser and eats all the food Even if the weak pig races to the dispenser before the food is gone the strong pig pushes the weak pig away The weak pig realizes this so it never pushes the lever first On the other hand if the strong pig pushes the lever the weak pig waits by the dispenser and eats most of the food But the strong pig can race to the dispenser and push the weak pig aside to claim the leftovers This makes it worthwhile for the strong pig to push the lever The outcome is that the strong pig does all the work and the weak pig does most of the eating As we explore together the virtual world that floats on the edge of this material life the many imaginative territories you inhabit bring back another reality I catch images of my own childhood wanderings through Narnia the land of hobbits and Mowgli s jungle All these are deep pleasures which combine all my senses and momentarily transport me into another dimension of living If I were to bring it all together I would say that among all the misery fear injustice and pain I hope you will not forget moments when all this fades away into periods of innocent joy It is when we bring all our powerful senses together perhaps in a moment in the garden of earthly delights that we triumph over despair So the moment when you dance to Handel or when you sit in a pool of wild flowers or gravely take part in your first tea ceremony these are the moments you will treasure They are with similar moments with friends and loved ones what makes being human bearable When I first began teaching I was invited to a workshop for new professors Like most people who teach at universities I had spent a long time learning what to teach but none learning how to teach it Somehow my university seemed to hope a weekend spent with experienced professors would make up for that My colleagues presented well crafted lectures about the tools they used in the classroom I enjoyed their presentations but do not remember a thing they said One thing that I do remember happened at a coffee break Finding myself alone I turned to a mathematics professor standing nearby I asked him what his favorite teaching tool was A cup of coffee he said I asked him how he used it Well he said I talk too much and too fast in the classroom Students sometimes have trouble following me So every once in a while when I ve said something I want my students to think about I stop and take a sip of coffee It lets what I ve just said sink in When we were called to the next talk he put down his cup and I noticed there was not a trace of coffee in it I thought that was rather odd and said so My doctor told me to stop drinking coffee he explained So I have always used an empty cup Doesn t make any difference I decided to try his idea in my class but not with an empty cup I took a cup of coffee with me to my next class Monday morning It helped My pauses as I drank the coffee not only gave my students time to think about what I had said but gave me time to think about what I was going to say next I began to use my pauses to look around the room to see how my students were reacting to what I had just said When I saw their attention wander I tried to bring them back When I saw them puzzled over some concept that I thought I had explained I gave another example My lectures became less organized and less brilliant but my students seemed to understand me better Younger workers tend to have more general skills and are less certain about where their skills might be put to their best uses Hence they tend to move between jobs on a regular basis But when they leave their old job they have little trouble finding a new one Older workers in contrast more often have skills that are quite specific to the industry or firm in which they are currently employed They already know their best employment option and are not inclined to move around between jobs When they do leave work however finding a position that matches well with their precise skills is often difficult and time consuming Thus unemployment that is a nuisance for a younger worker can be a damaging and financially draining experience for a mature worker Ralph was asked to work on the citizens general dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of city government After spending some time with people in the city he found one of the problems was the performance of the city planning department Many citizens complained that the planners were experts at drawing pictures that is physical planning and design but did nothing to coordinate what they were doing Ralph determined that the citizens complaints were justified so he trained the city planners in setting objectives selecting alternatives data analysis and coordination At the end of the training one of them said We ll use this in the future I m not going to be drawing boxes any more Another one said The most important thing is that we ve learned how to coordinate Ralph saw that the immediate short term payoff for the planning department was to become more responsive to the community and its growth When it comes to talking I have observed two basic personality types The first I call the Dead Sea People with this personality type have many experiences emotions and thoughts throughout the day They have a large reservoir where they store that information and they are perfectly happy not to talk On the other extreme is the Babbling Brook For this personality whatever enters into the eye gate or the ear gate comes out the mouth gate Many times a Dead Sea marries a Babbling Brook That happens because when they are dating it is a very attractive match If you are a Dead Sea and you date a Babbling Brook you will have a wonderful evening You do not have to think How will I get the conversation started tonight How will I keep the conversation flowing In fact you do not have to think at all All you have to do is nod your head and say Uh huh and she will fill up the whole evening and you will go home saying What a wonderful person On the other hand if you are a Babbling Brook and you date a Dead Sea you will have an equally wonderful evening because Dead Seas are the world s best listeners You will talk continuously for three hours He will listen intently to you and you will go home saying What a wonderful person You attract each other But five years after marriage the Babbling Brook wakes up one morning and says We ve been married five years and I don t know you The Dead Sea is saying I know you too well I wish you would stop the flow and give me a break The good news is that Dead Seas can learn to talk and Babbling Brooks can learn to listen We are influenced by our personality but not controlled by it There is an interesting relationship between a country s developmental progress and its population structure According to the theory of demographic transition nations go through several developmental stages The earliest stage is characterized by high birth and death rates and slow growth As they begin to develop the birth rate remains high but the death rate falls The result is that the population enters a period of rapid growth Then as industrialization peaks the birth rate falls and begins to approximate the death rate Eventually population growth slows drastically reaching a stage of very modest growth which is seen in many European nations today When a basketball team finds itself on the wrong side of momentum or when its opponent has gained the advantage the coach calls for a timeout The timeout can break the momentum and allows the coach to adjust the game plan He may have noticed a weakness on the other side that his team can utilize The pause along with the adjusted game plan can also increase the team s confidence and break its downward cycle It can change the rhythm of the game Likewise we must occasionally call timeout In the cycles of life and business we have times when we must break the rhythm of failure and loss During this break in the action we must determine what is working and what is not On the first day of Spanish class you read us a paragraph in a language that we knew nothing about and I didn t understand a word of it From the panicked faces I saw around the room none of my classmates did either You promised us that on the last day of class when you reread it we would understand I rolled my eyes knowing that there was no way I would be able to comprehend something so foreign by June I gave you days to prove me wrong but remained content in knowing that you wouldn t be able to do it My freshman year flew by Your Spanish class quickly became my favorite class You taught us through arts and crafts music and pictures All of your classes were incredibly visually stimulating Your classes were just unusual enough to be completely memorable Before I knew it I found myself looking forward to your class which was the last period of the day I barely realized that the th day had arrived I had done well throughout the year and felt that I had learned a reasonable amount of new information but that certainly didn t mean that I understood Spanish You still had to prove me wrong as you d promised so many months ago I walked into your class for the last time ever skeptical and listened as you reread the passage from the first class My jaw dropped in amazement when as promised I understood every word All of those episodes of Muzzy cartoons and silly mnemonic devices had actually come together to form something surprisingly intelligible I looked around at the rest of the class The stunned faces that surrounded me proved that everyone else had also understood The feeling of pride and accomplishment that came over me was incredible and it is something that I will never forget Mel a chimpanzee in Gombe Nigeria was three years old when his mother died He had no elder brother or sister to adopt him To our amazement he was adopted by a twelve year old chimpanzee Spindle who was certainly not related to Mel As weeks passed the two became inseperable Spindle took care of Mel while traveling he permitted the infant to ride on his back even allowed him to hang beneath as a mother carries her baby Most remarkably if Mel got too close to the big males Spindle would hurry to remove his small charge from danger even though this meant he got into trouble himself For a whole year this relationship endured and there was no doubt that Spindle saved Mel s life Why did Spindle act that way burdening himself with the care of a sickly youngster Probably we shall never know but it is interesting to reflect that during the plague that claimed Mel s mother Spindle s mother also died Is it possible that Spindle s loss of his mother left an empty space in his life And that the contact with a dependent baby helped to fill that space Or did Spindle experience an emotion similar to that which we call sympathy Perhaps lonely chimpanzee felt a mixture of both Every musician brings his or her own ideas and talents to a composition so the results can be as varied and unique as fingerprints Classical music is like perpetually wet clay A musician grabs hold of it and molds it according to personal tastes and experiences leaving an impress on the music But it s never a permanent imprint the next musician to come along can smooth out the clay and mold it in a completely different way Obviously this sort of freedom can be abused A musician who has not researched the composer and the composition sufficiently may make decisions about tempos or phrasing that are inappropriate even harmful to the piece There are however relatively few absolutes in music There is always room for new approaches A finance professor once told me that the best way to predict the future is to study the past For a while I thought that was only applicable in finance In reality this is true in more than finance When we seek employment the negativity of the experience is often more magnified than the positive We tend to gravitate toward what is not happening rather than what is At some point during your job search you will question the source of all this negativity The fear of the unknown and what the next step will be is what is happening So how might you turn all this around and move in a positive direction The step toward the positive direction is to identify your barriers come to terms with them and decide to move on What works for most job seekers is to look through their past experiences to help them build for the future There was a man who had four sons He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly So he sent them each on a quest in turn to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away The first son he sent in the winter the second in the spring the third in the summer and the youngest son in the fall When they had all gone and come back he called them together to describe what they had seen The man then explained to his sons that they were all right because they had each seen only one season in the tree s life He said You should not judge a tree by only one season The same is true of people s lives A person s life can only be measured at the end when all the seasons are up Therefore sons don t give up when it s winter If you do you will miss the promise of your spring the beauty of your summer and the fulfillment of your fall The first son said that the tree was ugly bent and twisted The second son said it was covered with green buds and full of promise The third son disagreed he said it was filled with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful The last son disagreed with all of them he said it was ripe and bending with fruit full of life and fulfillment The Big Friendly Giant expressed a wish to learn how to speak properly and Sophie volunteered to give him lessons every day She even taught him how to spell and to write sentences and he turned out to be an excellent pupil In his spare time he read books He became a tremendous reader He read all of Charles Dickens and all of Shakespeare and literally thousands of other books He also started to write essays about his own past life When Sophie read some of them she said These are very good I think perhaps one day you could become a real writer I heard a young boy on television say If I were President I d give everybody enough money to buy whatever they want Wonderful as this might sound such a policy would be a complete disaster If everyone could receive all the money they needed what would happen No one would work to produce goods and services Then money would be meaningless Life itself is that way too It s only worth what you put into it In other words a life of value is possible only when you are willing to put forth an effort Just remember that you will never get something for nothing When I was in school my best friend was a young fellow called Shawn He was very skilled at using words In English class whenever we had to write an essay he always received the highest mark Spending time with him was also great fun Whatever Shawn did I wanted to do too When Shawn decided to pursue writing as a career I made the same choice My father s dream for me however was that I should become a physician When we sat down to discuss it I told him No I don t want to be a doctor I have no interest in medicine I want to be a great writer one day Not long after on my fourteenth birthday my father gave me some great literature to read including Of Human Bondage by W Somerset Maugham Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis and Magnificent Obsession by Lloyd C Douglas Although he didn t mention it at the time all these books were about doctors And they made such a deep impression that they sparked in me a desire to become one myself Becoming a physician seemed to me to be an ideal way to begin to explore the human mind I thought that by understanding the mysteries of the human body perhaps I could someday get down to the level of the soul If I had not met Shawn I might never have developed my love of literature and writing And if my father had acted differently I might have become a journalist I appreciate both Shawn and my father who led me to the life I enjoy so thoroughly today A legend explaining tea s origins involves Dharma the father of Zen Buddhism According to this legend Dharma traveled from India to China in A D There he demonstrated the Zen art of meditation to the Chinese by sitting in front of a wall for nine years But one unfortunate day he fell into a light sleep When he awoke he was very angry with himself So he cut off his eyelids to make sure he would never sleep again The bloody eyelids fell to the ground They became a tea plant from which a drink that lessened sleepiness could be made Humans use living organisms for many purposes We breed crops and farm animals for food We breed dogs for companionship sport and appearance We breed flowers to look attractive We use bacteria and fungi to make foods like yogurt and cheese In breeding these living organisms we try to keep their best traits Two cows for example might vary in size color size of horns ability to survive the cold and amount of milk produced When farmers choose which cow to breed from they will choose the one with the most useful characteristics They will hope that the genes for these characteristics will be passed on to the cow s calf This is called artificial selection Artificial selection has been going on ever since humans first began to domesticate animals Over many generations it can have big effects on the characteristics of the animals or plants being bred You only have to look at all the different varieties of dogs to see what selective breeding and artificial selection can do All desert plants have tricks for dealing with great heat and long periods of dryness or drought Many small desert plants appear on the landscape only when heavy rains fall These plants wait out periods of drought underground They exist for months or even years as seeds buried in the soil When rains come these seeds spring to life The young plants quickly grow into adult plants and in turn throw out a new bunch of seeds before they die All this happens within a few weeks The boomerang a light thin and well balanced missile was the very first Australian invention It could be thrown into the air to imitate a hawk causing birds to get frightened and fly into nets where they were caught However boomerangs were mostly used in competitions between native tribes The idea was to see who could make the boomerang do the most circles in flight before it returned to the thrower s feet Today the boomerang is used by college lecturers to demonstrate the principles of aerodynamics Change happens to us all at some point in our life I am no exception When I was young I went through serious growing pains My ankles and knees ached at night It hurt and it was a little scary My mother told me that it had something to do with growth plates She explained that I should accept the aches and pains gladly because they meant that I was growing fast When other painful changes came along in later life I always recalled my mother s words And recently when a friend of mine was having a hard time dealing with the loss of his job I gave him the same advice At first he couldn t accept it but after a while he came to see that this was one of the changes that happen to everyone In the end losing a job motivated him to start his own business These experiences have taught me that change which is an essential part of our life can have both positive and negative effects It may hurt us a little when it occurs but if we accept it as a growth process it will bring benefits in the long run My best advice is to go with the flow Keep an open mind and be optimistic Pests are a concern for collection preservation and a health risk and both issues must be addressed by a facilities management plan Pest management starts with good housekeeping so the museum s overall custodial staff must be considered part of the pest management team A program should be established that looks for likely invasion routes of pests into a museum facility and takes steps to prevent use of these routes Efforts should be made to prevent pests from entering the museum building at points such as visitor entrances service entrances air intake points food facilities windows and cracks and breaks in the building Housekeeping should be concentrated at these points of entry It was a long day which included picking up my teenager On our way home we stopped at the local grocery store to get some fruits and vegetables After unloading our cart at the checkout I realized that my wallet was not in my purse I didn t know what to do Without any hesitation the lady in front of me said Put it through I ll take care of it I hesitated and hesitated but she insisted I asked about how to pay her back and she said I could leave it with the staff in an envelope for Ann from The Crimson Company She didn t ask for my name or phone number not a thing For my son and me it was a lovely gift to start off the new year She reminded me that life is too short to not lend a helping hand when the opportunity arises In England Dr Peter Messent followed people on their walks through city parks and found that people with dogs were much more likely to be engaged in conversation than people who were walking alone People with pets were even more approachable than mothers with small infants The same kind of results were observed in another study by Randall Lockwood He showed subjects a series of relatively ambiguous pictures of people in a variety of common social settings There were two similar sets of pictures in one there were only people and in the other there was a pet with one of the people in each scene The subjects were asked to rate each of the people in the pictures according to several scales The results were predictable People with pets were perceived as being more socially attractive and as having more desirable personal characteristics Pets changed the people s social identity for the better Not just information but also people may move between societies taking their knowledge and cultural practices with them Like war migration is an ancient phenomenon and very common throughout history Although it is often regarded with suspicion immigration tends to confer benefits on the host group In recent history countries with the highest net inward migration have also had the highest growth rates the two factors clearly being linked in harmony The complaint that immigrants take people s jobs is like similar complaints about technology based on an erroneously static view of the world In fact immigrants increase the size of the market and thus create jobs Furthermore they arrive as already productive adults having never been dependent on the host country They also tend to be motivated and intelligent individuals with a talent for the creation of economic organization If you ever tried to cut wood with a blunt dull axe you know how much effort it takes to succeed But as soon as the blade is filed sharp the work can proceed with much less exertion The secret lies in knowing when to stop and sharpen the blade The same principles hold true for work If you are stuck in a pattern of doing the same things every day and you feel as though you are becoming dull perhaps it is time to stop and sharpen your axe Sign up for a business seminar read business books or magazines or attend a trade show Take decisive action to restore a sharp edge to your productivity This is the very reason professionals such as accountants lawyers and nurses are required to continuously learn what s new in the profession in order to remain uptodate and useful in their professions Stay motivated and accept no excuses for not increasing your efficiency and effectiveness We want realness in the executive suite in the superintendent s office and in our religious leaders We yearn for leaders who are themselves rather than a copy of someone else We want leaders who will be fully human with us men and women who are vulnerable enough to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses their gifts and limits and who are appropriately transparent about their hopes and fears their motivations and their agendas We trust leaders who are real who walk their talk who act on their core values and who tell us the truth We authorize others to lead who author their own life Those we deem not trustworthy we don t authorize to lead Life is rhythmic cyclical and always evolving It s difficult not to notice repetition and renewal going on all around you Just as darkness comes at the end of each day so also comes the dawn to spread light across the land Just as plants must die at the end of their life cycle the seeds they have produced will emerge as new plants in the spring Understanding the cyclical nature of life will reassure you that difficult times won t last forever and you will feel joy and happiness again The rough times must be endured and taken as they come but they are not constant nor do they last forever There will always be good times and bad feasts and famines hot summers and cold winters Technology is the basis of many of our metaphors and is important in terms of how we think and how our ideas progress The use of metaphor and the process of design and the evolution of science and technology are cyclic in the sense that metaphors help to shape technology and new technology leads to new metaphors Major changes arise periodically such as moving from horsedrawn carriages to motordriven vehicles The initial description of the latter is naturally metaphorical as in the term horseless carriage The association with the previous technology is both verbal and visual The early designs of such vehicles show visual evidence of the metaphor as they retained much of the appearance of horsedrawn carriages The horsedrawn carriage was itself a technological innovation as were the horseless carriage and later automobiles As the new century begins the competition between cars and crops for cropland is intensifying Until now the paving over of cropland has occurred largely in industrial countries home to four fifths of the world s million automobiles But now more and more farmland is being sacrificed in developing countries with hungry populations calling into question the future role of the car Millions of hectares of cropland in the industrial world have been paved over for roads and parking lots Each U S car for example requires on average hectares of paved land for roads and parking space For every five cars added to the total number of cars in the U S an area the size of a football field is covered with asphalt More often than not cropland is paved simply because the flat welldrained soils that are well suited for farming are also ideal for building roads Once paved land is not easily reclaimed The fact that dreaded diseases are more common in the tropics than at higher latitudes may in part explain a curious feature of how languages are distributed near the equator language densities the number of languages per unit area are much higher and language communities the number of people speaking a given language very much smaller than they are at higher latitudes One explanation for this might be that it is a culturally evolved strategy to reduce the risk of crossinfection in areas where pathogens are more densely concentrated Language barriers significantly reduce the opportunities for contact between different populations thus minimizing the risk of contamination Creating smaller more inwardlooking xenophobic societies may thus help to reduce exposure to diseases to which one has no natural immunity The absence of an audience has affected performers of all types and traditions Before the era of the phonograph Hindustani classical musicians not only took inspiration from their listeners but also improvised directly in response to their reactions The exact sound and shape of the performance then was determined in part by the interaction of artist and audience For those who recorded one way to compensate was to manufacture an audience planting enthusiastic listeners in the studio On an acousticera recording of Maujuddin Khan for example one can hear a few plants shouting Wah Wah Maujuddin Khan In a more recent example I myself was an unwitting plant in a recording session for the rock group Rotoglow After observing from the control room I was invited to sit in the studio while the band was recording Squeezed between the lead guitarist and the drummer I was sure I was a distraction and after a few songs I volunteered to return to the other side of the glass To my surprise the group insisted that I stay You re a part of this man one of them declared I hardly acted like a typical rock concertgoer I sat quietly in a chair my only actions consisting of taking notes and stuffing my ears with wadded toilet paper Nevertheless my presence must have in some way met the band s need or desire for an audience When Amy heard her name called she stood up from her seat and made her way to the stage Dr Wilkinson was pinning a gold medal on each of the top five medical graduates He shook Amy s hand and congratulated her on her accomplishment Amy felt overwhelmingly thrilled for being mentioned as one of the top five medical graduates of her school Amy walked back to her seat satisfied with her academic performance and pleased with her success She just received a special honor This special recognition would help her to continue fulfilling her life long dream of becoming a dedicated doctor Don t let distractions interrupt your attentive listening to the speaker You want to send the message that what the speaker is saying is important to you That message will ring hollow if you answer your cell phone and put the speaker on hold If your cell phone rings while you are in a conversation fight the urge to answer For reasons unknown most people feel compelled to answer a ringing phone The fact that your cell phone is ringing doesn t mean you have to answer it Rarely are phone calls urgent If no message is left that is clearly the case And if a message is left you can listen to it usually in a matter of minutes once your conversation has finished Even in today s tech savvy world answering phone calls during a conversation is disrespectful Imagine a tree Let s suppose this tree represents the tree of life On this tree there are fruits In life our fruits are called our results So we look at the fruits our results and we don t like them there aren t enough of them they re too small or they don t taste good So what do we tend to do Most of us put even more attention and focus on the fruits our results But what is it that actually creates those particular fruits It s the seeds and the roots that create those fruits It s what s under the ground that creates what s above the ground It s what s invisible that creates what s visible So what does that mean It means that if you want to change the fruits you will first have to change the roots If you want to change the visible you must first change the invisible One might wonder whether there is any reason to be concerned about overconfidence in students After all confidence is often considered a positive trait Indeed research suggests that students who are confident about their ability to succeed in school tend to perform better on academic tests than those with less confidence That said negative consequences also stem from being too confident in the classroom Students who are overconfident about their ability to succeed in college end up feeling more disconnected and disillusioned than those with more modest expectations Overconfidence can also leave students with mistaken impressions that they are fully prepared for tests and no longer need to study Students who have relatively accurate perceptions regarding their progress in learning tend to use more effective study habits and perform better on tests than do those with more error prone views of their knowledge In the history of sports and in our winning is everything culture I m not aware of anyone who ever won every game or every event or every championship they competed for Roger Federer the great tennis player who some call the greatest of all time has won a record seventeen Grand Slam titles Yet he has competed in more than sixty Grand Slam events Thus perhaps the greatest tennis player ever failed more than two thirds of the time While we don t think of him as a failure but rather as a champion the plain fact is he failed much more than he succeeded on this measure and that s generally the way things are for anyone Failure precedes success Simply accept that failure is part of the process and get on with it People are attracted to individuals and things they cannot readily obtain In the case with things people are more attracted to a desired object because it is out of their reach When the object of desire is finally gained the attraction for the object rapidly decreases Christmas presents provide a good example of this phenomenon Toys children wanted all year long are thrown away several days after they are taken from gift boxes under the tree The phenomenon also holds true for human interaction particularly in the early stages of a developing relationship The common dating rule has scientific merit An individual should not always make himself or herself readily available to the person they are targeting for a longer term relationship For example doctors put in a positive mood before making a diagnosis show almost three times more intelligence and creativity than doctors in a neutral state and they make accurate diagnoses percent faster Salespeople who are optimistic sell more than those who are pessimistic by percent Students who are made to feel happy before taking math achievement tests perform much better than their neutral peers It turns out that our brains are literally programmed to perform at their best not when they are negative or even neutral but when they are positive Questions convey interest but sometimes the interest they convey is not closely related to what the person is trying to say Sometimes the distraction is obvious If you re telling a friend all the unpleasant things you experienced on your vacation and she interrupts with a lot of questions about where you stayed you won t feel listened to At other times people seem to be following but can t help trying to lead These listeners force their own narrative structures on our experience Problems should be denied or made to go away Everyone should be together Bullies must be confronted By finishing our sentences pumping us with questions and otherwise pushing us to say what they want to hear controlling listeners violate our right to tell our own stories Recent experimental evidence for the importance of reputation in facilitating cooperation has come from an analysis of the contributions to an honesty box for drinks in a university departmental coffee room Bateson and colleagues looked at contributions to the box when images always posted above the recommended price list of a pair of eyes were alternated on a weekly basis with images of flowers The amount of milk consumed turned out to be the best indicator of total consumption but remarkably almost three times more money was paid per liter in weeks when there were eyes portrayed compared to when there were flowers portrayed Of course this experiment was only conducted in one location but the effect size is impressive and it seems to indicate that individuals do not want to be observed cheating the system When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows the seventh and final volume of J K Rowling s fantasy series about the adventures of a boy wizard was released in the United States in it sold million copies in its first hours on sale Was the last Harry Potter book that good Perhaps it and the earlier six volumes were genuinely brilliant despite the fact that eight publishers declined to publish the first volume But although success is at least partly determined by intrinsic quality it is also possible that what people come to like depends very much on what they believe others like In such a world the explanation for why a particular book becomes a hit may be as simple as this publisher s It sold well because lots of people bought it Because social information is now being shared much more widely across virtual and actual borders than in the past cultural artifacts such as books and movies can now snowball in popularity in ways they could not a century ago turning cultural commerce into a collection of difficult to predict winner take all markets Tiny differences in performance or product quality translate into vast differences in payoff After much consideration I have come to the conclusion that the views of the Townsville Citizens Association and of myself have become distinctly different over the past year I no longer feel that I can be a useful contributor to the goals and mission of the organization So I am writing to inform you that after much thought I am regretfully resigning as a member of the Townsville Citizens Association I also wish you to know that even though I may no longer be a member I still sincerely hope for the continued success of this organization By the tenth frame my heart began to race Cory Laura and Gray were ahead of me but only by a few points The other kids were way behind us I studied the score sheet If I could bowl a strike in this frame I would win the game My hands were sweaty I dried them off on a towel I stepped onto the lane I took a deep breath Raised the ball Sent it rolling down the center of the lane And knocked down all ten pins I had bowled a strike on my last turn I pumped my fist in the air and came back to the bench victoriously Imagine for a moment that today was your last day on Earth Now make a list for yourself of all the things that you feel you have accomplished all the things you are proud of and all the things that make you happy Is your car on the list Your television Is your salary on the list No What s on the list are the fundamental elements of a satisfied life your relationship with friends and family the contribution you have made to others lives the celebrated events of your life Those are the building blocks of your list Many of us live day to day as if the opposite were true Instead of appreciating what is truly important and making that our priority we collect things and indicators of success without questioning just what success really means Remember what really matters in your life We have constructed so many large reservoirs to hold water and they are located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere rather than randomly around the globe As a result enough of Earth s mass has shifted to speed up its rotation Currently huge reservoirs hold some trillion tons of water Before the reservoirs were built this water was located in the ocean which has most of its mass in the Southern Hemisphere The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls her arms in to turn faster Because natural factors in the environment such as the pull of tides are gradually slowing Earth s rotation the human influence is accidentally working against the natural rate of deceleration The shift in Earth s mass has also changed the location of the axis on which Earth rotates Studies show that narrative feedback on students performance is better than grades at both promoting kids self motivation to learn and boosting their achievement Primary school teachers do a good job of providing feedback in reports but as soon as grades take over from narrative comments as the main method of evaluation students and parents begin to lose out When teachers offer information such as You did a great job of planning your ideas for this paper and formulating your main argument but your body paragraphs don t address the question raised by the argument in response to a rough draft of a paper the student has information that praises the positive elements addresses failures and gives useful information for her better performance In this way informational feedback works much like praise for efforts and similarly boosts enthusiasm for the task and later performance Poetry sharpens our senses and makes us more keenly and fully aware of life Imagine for a moment that you are trying to describe one of your friends You could say the friend is tall has blue eyes a mole on the left cheek or a red nose But that would only describe the outside of this person It wouldn t tell people what your friend is really like the habits feelings all the little peculiarities that make this person what he or she is and different from everyone else You would find it very difficult indeed to describe the inside of your friend even though you feel you know such a great friend through and through Now good poetry does describe life in that way it tells us about its inside as well as its outside and thus it helps you to know and love the world as intimately as you know and love a friend Mathematical models of flocks of birds and schools of fish and swarms of insects that move in unison demonstrate the same point there is no central control of the movement of the group This behavior does not reside within individual creatures but rather is a property of groups Examination of flocks of birds deciding where to fly reveals that they move in a way that accounts for the intentions of all the birds and even more important the direction of movement is usually the best choice for the flock Each bird contributes a bit and the flock s concerted choice is better than an individual bird s would be The Neanderthals would have faced a problem when it was daylight the light quality is much poorer at high latitudes and this would have meant that they couldn t see things in the distance so well For a hunter this is a serious problem because you really don t want to make the mistake of not noticing the mother rhinoceros hiding in a dark corner of the forest edge when trying to spear her calf Living under low light conditions places a much heavier premium on vision than most researchers imagine It is the familiar principle from conventional star gazing telescopes under the dim lighting of the night sky a larger mirror allows you to gather more of the light from whatever you want to look at By the same token a larger retina allows you to receive more light to compensate for poor light levels It s possible to lie with numbers even those that are accurate because numbers rarely speak for themselves They need to be interpreted by writers And writers almost always have purposes that shape the interpretations For example you might want to announce the good news that unemployment in the United States stands at just a little over percent That means percent of Americans have jobs an employment rate much higher than that of most other industrial nations But let s spin the figure another way In a country as populous as the United States unemployment at percent means that millions of Americans don t earn a daily wage Indeed one out ofeverytwentyadults who wants work can t find it Suddenly that s a sobering number Inappropriate precision means giving information or figures to a greater degree of apparent accuracy than suits the context For example advertisers often use the results of surveys to prove what they say about their products Sometimes they claim a level of precision not based reliably on evidence So if a company selling washing powder claims of British adults agree that this powder washes whiter than any other then this level of precision is clearly inappropriate It is unlikely that all British adults were surveyed so the results are based only on a sample and not the whole population At best the company should be claiming that over of those asked agreed that their powder washes whiter than any other Even if the whole population had been surveyed to have given the result to two decimal points would have been absurd The effect is to propose a high degree of scientific precision in the research Frequently however inappropriate precision is an attempt to mask the unscientific nature of a study Although organisms interact with their surroundings in many ways certain factors may be critical to a particular species success A shortage or absence of this factor restricts the success of the species thus it is known as a limiting factor Limiting factors can be quite different from one species to another The limiting factor for many species of fish is the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water In a swiftly flowing tree lined mountain stream the level of dissolved oxygen is high and so provides a favorable environment for trout As the stream continues down the mountain the steepness of the slope decreases which results in fewer rapids where the water tumbles over rocks and becomes oxygenated In addition as the stream becomes wider the canopy of trees over the stream usually is thinner allowing more sunlight to reach the stream and warm the water Warm water cannot hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water Therefore slower flowing warm water streams contain less oxygen than rapidly moving cool streams Fish such as black bass and walleye are adapted to such areas since they are able to tolerate lower oxygen concentrations and higher water temperatures Trout are not able to survive under such conditions and are not found in warm less well oxygenated water Thus low levels of oxygen and high water temperatures are limiting factors for the distribution of trout Finally it was Shaun s turn to give a speech When he opened his mouth nothing but air escaped his throat Then he tried to speak again not knowing what to say He had prepared to talk about time and he started with the word Time But nothing followed Shaun could not find the words Laughter started to pass through the auditorium from front to back Even the judges looked disappointed He didn t know what to say He looked into the crowd The audience at the contest were laughing out loud now at him at his inability Recent studies show some interesting findings about habit formation In these studies students who successfully acquired one positive habit reported less stress less impulsive spending better dietary habits decreased caffeine consumption fewer hours spent watching TV and even fewer dirty dishes Keep working on one habit long enough and not only does it become easier but so do other things as well It s why those with the right habits seem to do better than others They re doing the most important thing regularly and as a result everything else is easier Noise in the classroom has negative effects on communication patterns and the ability to pay attention Thus it is not surprising that constant exposure to noise is related to children s academic achievement particularly in its negative effects on reading and learning to read Some researchers found that when preschool classrooms were changed to reduce noise levels the children spoke to each other more often and in more complete sentences and their performance on prereading tests improved Research with older children suggests similar findings On reading and math tests elementary and high school students in noisy schools or classrooms consistently perform below those in quieter settings Studies from cities all over the world show the importance of life and activity as an urban attraction People gather where things are happening and seek the presence of other people Faced with the choice of walking down an empty or a lively street most people would choose the street with life and activity The walk will be more interesting and feel safer Events where we can watch people perform or play music attract many people to stay and watch Studies of benches and chairs in city space show that the seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people Consumers are generally uncomfortable with taking high risks As a result they are usually motivated to use a lot of strategies to reduce risk Consumers can collect additional information by conducting online research reading news articles talking to friends or consulting an expert Consumers also reduce uncertainty by buying the same brand that they did the last time believing that the product should be at least as satisfactory as their last purchase In addition some consumers may employ a simple decision rule that results in a safer choice For example someone might buy the most expensive offering or choose a heavily advertised brand in the belief that this brand has higher quality than other brands In small towns the same workman makes chairs and doors and tables and often the same person builds houses And it is of course impossible for a man of many trades to be skilled in all of them In large cities on the other hand because many people make demands on each trade one trade alone very often even less than a whole trade is enough to support a man For instance one man makes shoes for men and another for women And there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes another by cutting them out and another by sewing the uppers together Such skilled workers may have used simple tools About four billion years ago molecules joined together to form cells About two billion years later cells joined together to form more complex cells And then a billion years later these more complex cells joined together to form multicellular organisms All of these evolved because the participating individuals could by working together spread their genetic material in new and more effective ways Fastforward another billion years to our world which is full of social animals from ants to wolves to humans The same principle applies Ants and wolves in groups can do things that no single ant or wolf can do What do advertising and mapmaking have in common Without doubt the best answer is their shared need to communicate a limited version of the truth Ads will cover up or play down negative aspects of the company or service they advertise In this way they can promote a favorable comparison with similar products or differentiate a product from its competitors Likewise the map must remove details that would be confusing Did you know you actually think in images and not in words Images are simply mental pictures showing ideas and experiences Early humans communicated their ideas and experiences to others for thousands of years by drawing pictures in the sand or on the walls of their caves Only recently have humans created various languages and alphabets to symbolize these picture messages Your mind has not yet adapted to this relatively new development An image has a much greater impact on your brain than words the nerves from the eye to the brain are twentyfive times larger than the nerves from the ear to the brain You often remember a person s face but not his or her name A large American hardware manufacturer was invited to introduce its products to a distributor with good reputation in Germany Wanting to make the best possible impression the American company sent its most promising young executive Fred Wagner who spoke fluent German When Fred first met his German hosts he shook hands firmly greeted everyone in German and even remembered to bow the head slightly as is the German custom Fred a very effective public speaker began his presentation with a few humorous jokes to set a relaxed atmosphere However he felt that his presentation was not very well received by the German executives Even though Fred thought he had done his cultural homework he made one particular error Fred did not win any points by telling a few jokes It was viewed as too informal and unprofessional in a German business setting When someone has helped you but has perhaps not done all that you requested focus on what the person has done not on what he hasn t Although this would seem to be morally obvious many people are so caught up with their own needs that they ignore the good done for them A teacher once received a letter from a student asking fourteen unrelated questions on a variety of subjects The teacher wrote back a long reply in which he dealt with thirteen of the questions He soon received a return letter from the student who not only noted the omission but expressed no thanks for what the teacher had written Though the teacher was a man of great patience he was hurt by the student s behavior Not only was there no word of thanks but at the beginning of your letter you reminded me that there was one of your questions to which I forgot to give an answer Was that the proper beginning and response to a letter of ten pages He went on to tell the student I mention this not because I need your thanks but because of my love for you and concern that you should not become a person who denies the good done for him I rode my bicycle alone from work on the very quiet road of my hometown Suddenly I noticed a man with long hair secretly riding behind me I felt my heart jump I quickened my legs pushing the pedals hoping to ride faster He kept following me through the dark across the field At last I got home and tried to reach the bell The man reached for me I turned my head around and saw the oddest face in the world From deep in his throat I heard him say Excuse me you dropped your bag giving the bag back to me I couldn t say anything but was full of shame and regret for misunderstanding him Much has been written and said about positive selftalk for example repeating to ourselves I am wonderful when we feel down I am strong when going through a difficult time or I am getting better every day in every way each morning in front of the mirror The evidence that this sort of pep talk works is weak and there are psychologists who suggest that it can actually hurt more than it can help Little unfortunately has been written about real selftalk acknowledging honestly what we are feeling at a given point When feeling down saying I am really sad or I feel so torn to ourselves or to someone we trust is much more helpful than declaring I am tough or I am happy The word sin itself is an interesting concept It s actually a term from archery and it means to miss the mark When we commit the sin of failing to take care of our bodies through proper nutrition exercise and rest we re missing the mark of what life is all about Businesspeople will tell you that the individual who is in the best physical shape often wins in negotiations because he has the physical stamina to see the deal through One of the reasons worldclass golfers are head and shoulders above the other golfers of their era is that they are in so much better shape than the others are They work out not just on the practice range but in the weight room which means that they have the strength and stamina to win not just the physical game but the mental game in order to close out their opponents in major tournaments Introducing recovery in all aspects of my life has transformed my overall experience In four or five intensive houranda half sessions each followed by at least fifteen minutes of recovery I get just about as much done as I did previously in a twelvehour marathon day Taking one full day off every week makes me more productive overall rather than less so And finally I have come to see vacations as a good investment Today like a sprinter I get as much work done as I did previously like a marathon runner in a lot less time and with a lot more energy and positive emotions I spend more time with my family and friends and when I do I am more present There is no magic here I am simply paying better attention to my human needs Children sometimes see and say things to please adults teachers must realize this and the power it implies Teachers who prefer that children see beauty as they themselves do are not encouraging a sense of aesthetics in children They are fostering uniformity and obedience Only children who choose and evaluate for themselves can truly develop their own aesthetic taste Just as becoming literate is a basic goal of education one of the key goals of all creative early childhood programs is to help young children develop the ability to speak freely about their own attitudes feelings and ideas about art Each child has a right to a personal choice of beauty joy and wonder Aesthetic development takes place in secure settings free of competition and adult judgment When Charles Darwin developed his theory of natural selection he created a picture of the evolutionary process in which organismic adaptation was ultimately caused by competition for survival and reproduction This biological struggle for existence bears considerable resemblance to the human struggle between businessmen who are striving for economic success in competitive markets Long before Darwin published his work social scientist Adam Smith had already considered that in business life competition is the driving force behind economic efficiency and adaptation In the German rocketbomb attacks on London suddenly escalated Over two thousand V flying bombs fell on the city killing more than five thousand people and wounding many more Somehow however the Germans consistently missed their targets Bombs that were intended for Tower Bridge or Piccadilly would fall well short of the city landing in the less populated suburbs This was because in fixing their targets the Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England They did not know that these agents had been discovered and that in their place Englishcontrolled agents were giving them subtly deceptive information The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time they fell By the end of the attack they were landing on cows in the country  If you really stop and think about it most of what average people spend their money on revolves around the consumption of commodities When you wake up in the morning you might drink a cup of coffee On the way to work you might put gasoline in your car When you pay your electric bills buy a car buy clothes or even bake a cake you are spending money on commodityrelated expenses The prices of these items are dependent on the prices of the physical commodities For instance when crude oil prices rise because of increased tensions in the Middle East you can easily see this in gasoline prices When excessive heat drives up demand for natural gas you can also see this in your utility bill This is an observation that is both obvious and upon exploration deeply profound and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations Which do you think for example has a higher suicide rate countries whose citizens declare themselves to be very happy such as Switzerland Denmark Iceland the Netherlands and Canada or countries like Greece Italy Portugal and Spain whose citizens describe themselves as not very happy at all Answer the socalled happy countries If you are depressed in a place where most people are pretty unhappy you compare yourself to those around you and you don t feel all that bad But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face Sometimes animals seem unconcerned even when approached closely whereas other times they disappear in a flash when you come in sight Animals tend to be disturbed by unexpected and unpredictable events quick movements and loud noises are particularly stressful Animals that are regularly disturbed by visitors are more likely to tolerate your intrusion than those that have had little previous contact with humans In Yellowstone National Park for example elk that live close to the town of Mammoth Hot Springs typically do not flee until crosscountry skiers get within fifty feet In more remote parts of the park however elk take flight when skiers are as much as a quarter mile away An artist or a child simply accepts whatever is in front of them as tool toy or environment and proceeds from that point Part of what is invigorating about the creative process is that it can start from humble materials and poor beginnings There is a term in painting called working with a limited palette a deliberate choice to work with fewer colors than actually available With fewer options an artist can work more easily less colors actually inspire her to creative resolutions As a designer I am often called upon to work with existing elements logos color palettes slogans etc I see these limits as elements that actually help me it is the limitations that help me free my creative imagination Contemporary artist Vik Muniz uses everyday materials to replicate classic artwork He has used chocolate syrup to render Leonardo da Vinci s Last Supper and has recreated the Mona Lisa with peanut butter and jelly He uses what is around him from spaghetti to toy soldiers as the paint for his paintings Like a child who doesn t wait for the perfect tool or circumstances an artist makes art from what he has around him The artist sees inspiration where the ordinary person sees only a limitation or an obstacle We are reaching out to you because GeoWeb recently learned about a security incident potentially affecting the accounts of GeoWeb users We promptly hired leading information security experts to investigate this incident and reported the incident to law enforcement Our investigation has now confirmed that user names email addresses and passwords were acquired by an unauthorized third party We have no indication at this time that any user passwords have been used illegally but we strongly recommend that all users reset their passwords as soon as possible If you used the same password on any other site we encourage you to change your password there as well One time my boss and I were sitting around the table and I pitched an idea about the trend of screenplays being published and sold as literature My boss approved it It was the first time she had given me the goahead to report and write a feature It meant a lot to me that I d possibly have my name on a longer piece I felt so happy that I set about the work immediately I wrote a draft which was of course open to making revisions My boss reviewed it and just said No this isn t working She didn t say why or offer advice about how to fix it I knew that the first draft wouldn t be perfect still I wasn t prepared for such an instant rejection It was almost as if she drained my energy and enthusiasm Suppose a child throws a ball to another child intending to start a game of catch The other child is not watching and the ball hits the child on the head The child cries and runs to tell the teacher about the aggressive behaviour of the other naughty child Of course the child who threw the ball is innocent but if we have defined aggression in terms of pure behaviour the consequences of an act then the child who throws the ball is unfairly guilty Clearly we need to take intention into account when we define aggression We can now move to a more complete definition if we say that aggression is any behaviour that is intended to hurt others A new development may take years to evolve If people are only informed of a new proposal in its final stages their role is often limited to the negative one of rejecting it Their protests are then seen by planners and developers as an expensive nuisance so the public become the enemy Many people would like their voices to be heard from the initial stages of a proposed new development instead of at the last stages of an application Some architects and developers see this as a threat and insult to their professional skills rather than a twoway process beneficial to all parties Of course the public cannot design a building but its involvement at an early stage adds to the information available and replaces a confrontational them and us situation by a democratic process of participation and consultation This situation is now changing as the importance of public consultation becomes increasingly recognised Birds as a whole group are more sensitive to changes in their environment than other animals so when they start falling off perches we should all be troubled They are in the forwardmost trench of nature s resistance against the relentless attrition of environmental degradation Our birds are nature s early warning system and the scientists are telling us that if we don t start acting on their distress signals it won t be long before the rest of the animal world is overrun as well The populations of many species are declining rapidly because habitats are being destroyed or undermined food sources are disappearing and tricked by the increasingly weird and unstable weather the birds migration and breeding patterns are changing In short birds are confused and under stress Just because you can hear your robins goldfinches and sparrows chirping away happily in the garden every morning don t be fooled into thinking that all is well in birdworld Appealing though it might be to offload the responsibility for teaching our students basic knowledge to their elementary school teachers or to the Internet the research of cognitive psychologists who study learning and the basic study habits of most students suggest that we cannot do this One of our first and most important tasks as teachers is to help students develop a rich body of knowledge in our content areas without doing so we handicap considerably their ability to engage in cognitive activities like thinking and evaluating and creating As cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham argued you can t think creatively about information unless you have information in your head to think about Research from cognitive science has shown he explained that the sorts of skills that teachers want for their students such as the ability to analyze and think critically require extensive factual knowledge We have to know things in other words to think critically about them One characteristic of people who have achieved peace of mind is their independence They trust their instincts Nobody can tell them what to think if their inner voices say otherwise Brendan O Regan tells about a doctoral student who placed an ad in an Idaho newspaper asking if anyone within a mile radius had experienced a remission Twentyfive people replied When she asked one of her interview subjects how she had felt when the doctor told her she had a terminal illness the woman simply said I figured that was his opinion We re used to being told all these things by all these experts from the federal government who come in and look at the soil They say Don t plant corn over there because it won t grow and you plant it and it grows beautifully So you realize the experts don t know everything When the doctor told me I was going to die in six months I said What does he know he s only an expert So closely is sniffing tied to odor perception that people routinely sniff when they are asked to imagine a smell Without prompting they take larger sniffs when imagining pleasant odors and smaller ones when imagining malodors During visual imagery the eyes explore an imagined scene using the same scan paths made when viewing the actual visual scene Preventing eye movements during visual imagery by having people stare at a stationary target reduces the quality of the image Smell researcher Noam Sobel found that similarly imagined odors were more vivid when people could sniff than when they were wearing nose clips and unable to sniff Actually sniffing increased the unpleasantness of an imagined bad smell urine and increased the pleasantness of a good one flowers People change over time often for the better Maturity wisdom patience and many other strengths can result from the gradual accumulation of life experiences But do these qualities have to develop slowly They conducted structured interviews with people who had just finished psychotherapy Reports of aha moments abounded One interviewee said that he could visualize the point at which he changed another said I could actually hear it Many of them could identify the moment at which they had their realizations such as in a swimming pool with a spouse or in a particular meeting with a therapist Some used familiar metaphors to describe their ahas such as a light being turned on a button being pressed a click or a ping and then it was like I could see things clearly Personal growth doesn t have to be a glacial process As physician author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr wrote A moment s insight is sometimes worth a life s experience Renewal and reform always depend on a capacity for going backwards to go forward Key to this process is a search within one s own mind for a model according to which reformed practice can be organized Architects have long appealed to a primitive hut as just such a model It is a structure thought to provide access as close to the first principles of architecture as it is possible to get yet traces of this structure exist nowhere other than in the mind s eye of the architect searching for it Nonetheless absence of the primitive hut from physical reality does little to diminish its importance for the renewal of present practices If a desired or required thing resides in paradise and no current map indicates its location getting to it will only be possible via dreams and wishes Even though it is impossible to get there returning to paradise nonetheless remains a reasonable destination for the memory still able by way of example to fulfill its promise to the here and now Perspective is defined as the art of picturing objects as they appear to the eye We have been taught to represent distant objects as smaller thereby giving the illusion of depth But are they really smaller The child knows that the man fifty feet away is just as big as the one five feet away So why draw one smaller than the other The child s drawings are not reproductions of an optical image He uses size to impart emphasis and importance He draws his concept of the object His drawing is consequently more meaningful than a faithful reproduction Objectivity can be achieved by photography Many true artists use distortion exaggeration or reduction to essentials The child draws the man bigger than the tree in his front yard because to him the man is more significant For the same reason we see the person bigger than the house Traditionally systems have been designed and developed from a technologycentered perspective Engineers developed the sensors and systems that were needed to perform each function They then provided a display for each system that informed the operator of how well that particular system was operating or its present status So for example in the aircraft cockpit a separate display was provided for altitude airspeed engine temperature etc As technology improved more and more displays were added People were left with the job of trying to keep pace with the dramatic growth of data created by this process In the face of changing tasks and situations the operator is called upon to find sort integrate and process the information that is needed from all that which is available leading inevitably to an information gap Unfortunately the human has certain information processing bottlenecks People can only pay attention to a certain amount of information at once As the display of data in these systems is centered around the technologies producing them it is often scattered and not ideally suited to support human tasks A considerable amount of additional work is required to find what is needed and extra mental processing is required to calculate the information the operator really wants to know This inevitably leads to higher than necessary workload and error Keeping up has become harder and harder to do The wind continued to blow harder He couldn t measure it by any conscious process but he knew somehow that it was blowing harder Not far away a tree was uprooted Other trees were falling spinning and criss crossing like matches He was amazed at the power of the wind The tree he was holding onto was swaying dangerously Nearby a woman was wailing and clutching a little girl who in turn hung on to her cat The sea washed across the strip of sand He saw the silhouettes of people huddled together against the churning white of the lagoon Things were getting worse every second Are you a rushaholic Do you happen to live in a fast paced city where you feel in a constant hurry A recent poll of over Americans found that nearly half felt they lacked enough time in daily life Time famine the feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do it is the cause of unnecessary stress and reduced performance We all tend to rush when we have so many things to do and that negatively affects our performance Doing things quickly actually ends up slowing you down such as when you rush out of your house only to realize you forgot your keys phone or wallet on the kitchen table Driving faster will not get you to your destination any sooner Assuming that by doing things faster you will get more done is a trap The trio of freeze flight and fight are fairly universal behavioral defensive reactions in mammals and other vertebrate species But some species have other options available such as playing dead which is also called tonic immobility Like freezing this behavior can help prevent attack but whereas in freezing muscles are contracted and poised to be used in fight or flight in tonic immobility the muscles of the body are relaxed Another such response is defensive burying Rodents will use their paws and head to shovel dirt toward an aversive stimulus Other behavioral options include making loud noises retreating into a shell rolling into a tight ball choosing to live in a predator free area such as underground or relying on safety in numbers by living in a group Katherine Schreiber and Leslie Sim experts on exercise addiction recognized that smartwatches and fitness trackers have probably inspired sedentary people to take up exercise and encouraged people who aren t very active to exercise more consistently But they were convinced the devices were also quite dangerous Schreiber explained that focusing on numbers separates people from being in tune with their body Exercising becomes mindless which is the goal of addiction This goal that she mentioned is a sort of automatic mindlessness the outsourcing of decision making to a device She recently sustained a stress fracture in her foot because she refused to listen to her overworked body instead continuing to run toward an unreasonable workout target Schreiber has suffered from addictive exercise tendencies and vows not to use wearable tech when she works out Your sense of smell links you directly with your feelings instincts and memories Scents have the power to stimulate states of well being By utilizing aromas in your daily habits you can enjoy the advantages of an intense state of health Find a scent that you like and inhale its perfume at times when you re feeling calmed and at peace Perhaps it s the incense that you burn during meditation a torch that you light during a calming bath or an aromatic oil spray that you put on your cushion before bedtime In time your body will connect these relaxed feelings with the usage of that specific scent When you encounter a moment of stress you can smell the aroma that you connect with a state of relax and that will produce a calming response throughout your whole body What is the true nature of the brain The brain is a slow changing machine and that s a good thing If your brain could completely change overnight you would be unstable Let s just say that your norm is to wake up read the paper with coffee and a bagel walk your dog and watch the news This is your habitual routine Then one night you get a phone call at a m and have to run outside in your underwear to check on your neighbors What if your brain latched on to this new routine and you continued to run outside at a m every night in your underwear Nobody would want that so it s a good thing our brains require more repetition than that Sound is simply vibrating air which the ear picks up and converts to electrical signals which are then interpreted by the brain The sense of hearing is not the only sense that can do this touch can do this too If you are standing by the road and a large truck goes by do you hear or feel the vibration The answer is both With very low frequency vibration the ear starts becoming inefficient and the rest of the body s sense of touch starts to take over For some reason we tend to make a distinction between hearing a sound and feeling a vibration but in reality they are the same thing Deafness does not mean that you can t hear only that there is something wrong with the ears Even someone who is totally deaf can still hear feel sounds Veblen goods are named after Thorstein Veblen a US economist who formulated the theory of conspicuous consumption They are strange because demand for them increases as their price rises According to Veblen these goods must signal high status A willingness to pay higher prices is due to a desire to advertise wealth rather than to acquire better quality A true Veblen good therefore should not be noticeably higher quality than the lower priced equivalents There is much evidence of this behavior in the markets for luxury cars champagne watches and certain clothing labels A reduction in prices might see a temporary increase in sales for the seller but then sales will begin to fall Power distance is the term used to refer to how widely an unequal distribution of power is accepted by the members of a culture It relates to the degree to which the less powerful members of a society accept their inequality in power and consider it the norm In cultures with high acceptance of power distance e g India Brazil Greece Mexico and the Philippines people are not viewed as equals and everyone has a clearly defined or allocated place in the social hierarchy In cultures with low acceptance of power distance e g Finland Norway New Zealand and Israel people believe inequality should be minimal and a hierarchical division is viewed as one of convenience only In these cultures there is more fluidity within the social hierarchy and it is relatively easy for individuals to move up the social hierarchy based on their individual efforts and achievements In Emily Holmes asked a group of adults to watch a video featuring eleven clips of traumatic content including graphic real scenes of human surgery and fatal road traffic accidents This was their trauma simulation and the participants were indeed traumatized Before watching the video they reported feeling calm and relaxed afterward they were disturbed and anxious Holmes forced the adults to wait for thirty minutes Then half the participants played a block matching puzzle video game for ten minutes while the other half sat quietly The adults went home for a week and recorded their thoughts in a daily diary Once a day they recalled the scenes from the video that replayed in their minds Those who had sat quietly after watching the video experienced an average of six flashbacks those who had played the game experienced an average of fewer than three The video game with its colors and music and rotating blocks prevented the initial traumatic memories from solidifying The game soaked up the mental attention that might have otherwise moved those horrific memories to long term memory and so they were stored imperfectly or not at all At the end of the week the adults returned to the lab and those who had been lucky enough to play the game reported fewer psychiatric symptoms The video game had functioned as a cognitive vaccine the researchers explained I was sorry to receive your letter I would like to see if there is some way we can address your concerns As your supervisor I feel that you have performed well in your time with the company your departure would be a big loss to us In your letter you make reference to personal conflicts you have had with some of the others in our department With your permission I would like to ask the Human Resources to become involved and look for a way to improve the working environment I m hoping that you reconsider your resignation Please allow us to try to keep a valued employee As Farish and I walked brown sandstones gave way to pink limestones which was a promising sign that fossils were in the neighborhood After we spent a few minutes peering at rocks alarm bells went off my attention was pulled to an unusual faint light flashing from a corner of a melonsized rock My heart pounded hard Experience in the field taught me to respect the sensation triggered by these moments I spent about five minutes curled up with the rock close to my eyes before passing it to Farish for his expert opinion Farish froze solid His eyes shot back to me with a look of suppressed emotion disbelief and surprise Yes we found it I cried Jumping with joy I hugged him You know the old saying about having only one chance to make a first impression Forget about it for once and give people a second chance Even if you didn t like someone s question at yesterday s lecture or you thought his outfit was outofplace for the event don t immediately write that person off as a potential friend This is a time in your life to dig deeper and allow yourself to find out what makes people behave the way they do Forget about surfaces and look for what s inside And remember it takes time for new friendships to develop As you get to know each other shared experiences and interests will become woven into the friendship Keep working on the relationship even if it feels uncomfortable at times When science is examined as an enterprise that involves the values of independence freedom the right to dissent and tolerance it is clear that as a social activity science cannot flourish in an authoritarian climate Some philosophers of science such as Bronowski claim that science cannot be practiced in authoritarian regimes In a democratic environment old ideas can be challenged and rigorously criticized although with some difficulty because of the human desire to hold onto old ideas especially by the original proposers Yet it is the essence of scientific thinking to propose alternative ideas and then to test them against existing concepts As pointed out in an American Association for the Advancement of Science report Science for All Americans indeed challenges to new ideas are the legitimate business of science in building valid knowledge Considering the multitude of ways people benefit from insects it is curious that insects continue to suffer from such an unfavorable reputation Ironically while many of us perceive insects as harmful pests dangerous ugly and disease ridden in reality without the service of pollination which they provide humankind might cease to exist The promotion of negative stereotypes of insects can be largely traced to failure by Europeans to appreciate or understand the customs of the lands they colonized and their misperception that the way of life of most indigenous populations they encountered was barbaric Many people s dislike for insects stems from a similar classist attitude that associates insects with indigenous people who lack the means to buy or grow alternate sources of food Again this prejudice stems largely from Western cultures In contrast cultures of many Eastern nations such as Japan and China consider various species of insects to be great delicacies Through evolution our brains have developed to deal with acute dangers whether sabertoothed cats or thunderstorms Our nerve connections will ensure that we become aware of the dangers and react to them to protect ourselves being alerted by their peculiar smell their threatening looks or their scary noise But nothing in our past has prepared us to deal with the insidious chemical threats that endanger the development of the next generation s brains On the contrary we are thoroughly enjoying the immediate benefits of attractive consumer goods efficient technologies and handsome profits that we generate from producing and disseminating hazardous chemicals Our senses are not geared toward detecting the underlying dangers The irony is that the resulting harm to the brain may wipe out some of those senses that we badly need to manage this very problem One of the most satisfactory aspects of using essential oils medicinally and cosmetically is that they enter and leave the body with great efficiency leaving no toxins behind The most effective way to use essential oils is not orally as one might think but by external application or inhalation The methods used include body oils compresses cosmetic lotions baths hair rinses inhalation by steam direct from the bottle or from a tissue perfumes room sprays and a whole range of room methods Although under supervision the essential oils can be prescribed for oral ingestion this is in fact their least effective mode of entry because it involves their passing through the digestive system where they come into contact with digestive juices and other matter which affect their chemistry This limitation also applies to any chemical medications Political acts vary in terms of contribution At one extreme within limits votes have equal weight We are each allowed only one per election contest But the principle of one person one vote does not obtain for other kinds of participation Individuals are free to write as many letters to public officials work as many hours in campaigns or join as many political organizations as their time and commitment allow Although there are no legal constraints on the number of phone calls a citizen can make to public officials or the number of marches a protester can attend the fact that there are only twentyfour hours in a day imposes an implicit ceiling In contrast despite some campaign finance laws there is no upper limit on the number of dollars that a person can contribute Morality often expresses itself as a duty to perform an action that advances the interests of another to the harm of one s own However moral actions usually do not occur in isolation but rather as part of a generalized system of reciprocity one that stands at the core of the social order in every human society This system of reciprocity generates benefits for everyone involved benefits such as freedom from worry of being robbed If observance of one s own duties represents the price of admission into this generalized system of reciprocity then it seems clear that respecting moral constraints also generates benefits The primary difference between morality and prudence is simply that in the latter case the longterm benefits are secured through one s own agency whereas in the former case they are mediated through the agency of another The dictionary of course is not the last word on the definition of bravery Philosophers have also advanced explanations of this elusive concept as have social scientists of all stripes I ll give you an example For decades my colleagues and I have studied happiness and the good life We know all about how money does and does not affect happiness and how happiness affects health and we understand how happiness changes across the life cycle But we have rarely stepped back and taken the time to ask people to define for themselves what they consider the good life to be The same is true of courage There are studies of how levels of courage differ from nation to nation and of how frequently women experience courage Still relatively few people have stopped to ask people what they think courage is What lies behind the claim that so many people will take off to virtual worlds Statistics show that the global market for video and computer game hardware and software today stands at about ten billion dollars annually and has risen continuously for the past several years Digital games the term that covers both video games and computer games have long been the preserve of the young but that distinction is fading This is apparently not the sort of thing one gives up as one grows up people born after seem to continue their gaming with more sophisticated and emotionally involved products Consistent with this industry statistics indicate that the average age of video gamers is rising by about one year each year It is already in the thirties right now People may change the kinds of games they are playing but an interest in interactive entertainment media once acquired seems never to fade A fundamental trait of human nature is its incredible capacity for adaptation In the realm of human psychology research has long noted the essential trait of adapting to life s events whether happy or tragic Whatever the hardship a person may experience the indicators of satisfaction quickly return to their initial levels A person seems to get used to everything which is both reassuring and depressing Thus across time and space the percentages of happy and unhappy people are remarkably unstable This is obviously mainly due to humans astonishing capacity of adaptation and imitation Any wealth or any progress is relative and quickly dissolves in a comparison with others When millionaires are asked about the size of the fortune necessary to make them feel truly at ease they all respond in the same way whatever the level of income they have already attained they need double what they already possess The heart of the problem is that people do not anticipate their own capacity to adapt They think that they might be happy if they were given a little more and then they would be satisfied but they are not The rise in income to come always makes one dream although once it is achieved this rise is never sufficient For people compare their future income to their current aspirations without taking into account the inevitable evolution of the aspirations This is the principal key to the vain quest for happiness Our class of was going to be returning for our momentous th reunion but I had sadly stated to one of my four kids that regretfully I was going to miss the reunion because I just couldn t afford the trip Then one evening my youngest daughter Kelly handed me an envelope and said Read this later A letter inside the envelope lectured me all about how important old friendships are at all ages and that I absolutely must attend my th reunion since it is a once in a lifetime event Included within was a round trip airline ticket to and from Syracuse and roughly cash The letter stated that all four siblings had met and agreed to pool their money to get me to the reunion And don t even think about payback I sat there in stunned silence And I wept Breaks are necessary to revive your energy levels and recharge your mental stamina but they shouldn t be taken carelessly If you ve planned your schedule effectively you should already have scheduled breaks at appropriate times throughout the day so any other breaks in the midst of ongoing work hours are unwarranted While scheduled breaks keep you on track by being strategic re energizing methods of self reinforcement unscheduled breaks derail you from your goal as they offer you opportunities to procrastinate by making you feel as if you ve got free time Taking unscheduled breaks is a sure fire way to fall into the procrastination trap You may rationalize that you re only getting a cup of coffee to keep yourself alert but in reality you re just trying to avoid having to work on a task at your desk So to prevent procrastination commit to having no random breaks instead A Princeton study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman found that once a person earns per year the emotional benefits of income wear off He analyzed more than responses to the Gallup Healthways Well Being Index a daily survey of U S residents conducted by the Gallup Organization and discovered that emotional well being rises with income but not beyond an annual income of What is the significance of It s not a magic number It appears to be the income considered adequate to meet people s basic needs And the researchers found that lower income did not in itself cause sadness but made people feel more burdened by the problems they already had In other words that old saying money can t buy happiness turns out to be true It turns out that the secret behind our recently extended life span is not due to genetics or natural selection but rather to the relentless improvements made to our overall standard of living From a medical and public health perspective these developments were nothing less than game changing For example major diseases such as smallpox polio and measles have been eradicated by mass vaccination At the same time better living standards achieved through improvements in education housing nutrition and sanitation systems have substantially reduced malnutrition and infections preventing many unnecessary deaths among children Furthermore technologies designed to improve health have become available to the masses whether via refrigeration to prevent spoilage or systemized garbage collection which in and of itself eliminated many common sources of disease These impressive shifts have not only dramatically affected the ways in which civilizations eat but also determined how civilizations will live and die Do you have a tendency to focus more on what you don t have than on what you do Unfortunately many people tend to focus on what they don t have when in reality they are sitting on a pile of blessings Unrealistic expectations and comparisons to others lead to jealousy Being envious of what others have only serves to make you unhappy with what you personally have It s hard to be grateful when all you can think about is what you don t have or think you should get Oftentimes frustration and dissatisfaction are actually the result of unrealistic expectations on our part We think our situation should be this way or that way or at least different from the way it is Gratitude is not about expectations but about being thankful for our situation no matter what our expectations may be At the Sixteenth Nobel Conference held in scientists musicians and philosophers all agreed to quote Freeman Dyson that the analogies between science and art are very good as long as you are talking about the creation and the performance The creation is certainly very analogous The aesthetic pleasure of the craftsmanship of performance is also very strong in science A few years later at another multidisciplinary conference physicist Murray Gell Mann found that everybody agrees on where ideas come from We had a seminar here about ten years ago including several painters a poet a couple of writers and the physicists Everybody agrees on how it works All of these people whether they are doing artistic work or scientific work are trying to solve a problem For several years much research in psychology was based on the assumption that human beings are driven by base motivations such as aggression egoistic self interest and the pursuit of simple pleasures Since many psychologists began with that assumption they inadvertently designed research studies that supported their own presuppositions Consequently the view of humanity that prevailed in psychology was that of a species barely keeping its aggressive tendencies in check and managing to live in social groups more out of motivated self interest than out of a genuine affinity for others or a true sense of community From that perspective social interaction is possible only by exerting control over those baser emotions and therefore it is always vulnerable to eruptions of violence greed and selfishness The fact that humans actually live together in social groups has traditionally been seen as a tenuous arrangement that is always just one step away from violence Large data sets have been constructed measuring firm environmental behavior and financial performance across a wide number of industries and over many years While the results are not unequivocal there is evidence suggestive of a positive correlation between environmental performance and financial performance In our own work we find that on average a decrease in a company s toxic emissions as reported in the US Environmental Protection Agency s Toxic Release Inventory a database of toxic emissions from US manufacturing facilities results in an average increase in a firm s financial performance as measured by return on assets Another study suggests that a reduction in emissions could result in a million increase in market value The science based approach claims that aesthetically relevant properties are only those properties that all members of a natural kind share with each other But this is not true When we experience nature we do not experience it as species but as individual objects And as separated into individual objects nature can have aesthetic properties that are not entailed by its scientific description Natural science can explain for instance the formation of the waterfall but it has nothing to say about our experience of the majestic Victoria Falls when viewed at sunset its reds and oranges countless and captivating geology can explain the formation of the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania but not its painful and breathtaking beauty at sunrise the fog slowly lifting above the crater and a lone hippopotamus dark and heavy in the lake There was an experiment conducted in by Sheena Iyengar a professor of business at Columbia University In a California gourmet market Professor Iyengar and her research assistants set up a booth of samples of jams Every few hours they switched from offering an assortment of bottles of jam to an assortment of just six bottles of jam On average customers tasted two jams regardless of the size of the assortment and each one received a coupon good for off one jar of jam Here s the interesting part Sixty percent of customers were drawn to the large assortment while only percent stopped by the small one But percent of the people who had sampled from the small assortment decided to buy jam while only three percent of those confronted with the two dozen jams purchased a jar Effectively a greater number of people bought jam when the assortment size was than when it was While complex blockchains exhibit a set of core characteristics which flow from the technology s reliance on a peer to peer network public private key cryptography and consensus mechanisms Blockchains are disintermediated and transnational They are resilient and resistant to change and enable people to store nonrepudiable data pseudonymously in a transparent manner Most if not all blockchain based networks feature market based or game theoretical mechanisms for reaching consensus which can be used to coordinate people or machines These characteristics when combined enable the deployment of autonomous software and explain why blockchains serve as a powerful new tool to facilitate economic and social activity that otherwise would be difficult to achieve At the same time these characteristics represent the technology s greatest limitations The disintermediated and transnational nature of blockchains makes the technology difficult to govern and makes it difficult to implement changes to a blockchain s underlying software protocol Because blockchains are pseudonymous and have a tamper resistant data structure supported by decentralized consensus mechanisms they can be used to coordinate socially unacceptable or criminal conduct including conduct facilitated by autonomous software programs Moreover because blockchains are transparent and traceable they are prone to being co opted by governments or corporations transforming the technology into a powerful tool for surveillance and control Mike Michalowicz the author of The Pumpkin Plan argues that comedians are the ultimate public speakers For example comedians have to hold an audience s attention for an hour or more they don t get a break during their presentation and they can t rely on the audience for a Q A They are also expected to make the audience laugh constantly And they don t even get to use presentation software programs because they want the audience looking at them not trying to read a screen These facts don t mean you need to be a comedian on stage to perform well You aren t even required to tell jokes To enhance your own presentations however start to observe the techniques comedians use and employ them in your own speech Ironically it s usually when we try to do everything right that we wind up doing something wrong That s because the more balls you try to juggle the more likely you are to drop one You hope many extracurricular activities will get you into your first choice college so you spend hours working out with the football club run for student government and volunteer for hours on free afternoons Meanwhile you make time to try to keep your grades up With that kind of pressure you can misread an assignment double book your schedule or otherwise let people down but it s not your parents fault or your friends They aren t expecting too much of you by asking for one spot in your hectic schedule It s up to you to recognize your limits not sign up for too many extracurricular activities and admit when you ve dropped the ball Surfing is often thought of as a male sport but in fact women have been surfing in California since the early s and today there are women surfers in every surfing country in the world Like men they range from amateurs to professionals Though women may not have been taken seriously in surf contests these days they compete because they have truly earned that right One of the earliest women surfers was Mary Hawkins who showed very graceful form in the surf She was the first in a long line which stretched down in the s to Marge Calhoun and her daughters and Linda Benson followed by some of the top professional surfers today When the going gets tough tough people New research from Brigham Young University shows that dads are in a unique position to help their children develop persistence According to the study when children felt warmth and love from their father were told the reasons behind rules and were granted an appropriate level of autonomy they were able to set a foundation to flourish and cope with the stress and pressures of life Over time kids with fathers involved in their lives were more likely to become persistent which led to higher engagement in school and lower rates of delinquency After following families over several years two professors Laura Walker and Randal Day concluded that dads play a big role in helping their kids set goals and complete themOriginally a Dutch auction referred to a type of auction that starts with a high price that keeps going down until the item sells This is the opposite process from regular auctions where an item starts at a minimum price and bidders wrestle over it by increasing their offers In a Dutch auction however the auctioneer offers the item at a certain price and waits for somebody to agree If nobody does then he This continues until a participant says yes and thus wins the item There are no battles over items in a Dutch auction the first person to accept the offered price wins the item resulting in saving a lot of time Order effect is the prejudicial impact that the presentation order of a question idea answer or product has on a respondent Whether the item is located in the first last or middle position sometimes affects the selection of or response to that item There have been several studies that have noticed an order effect when an early stimulus acts as a frame of reference for later stimuli Robert Ferber from Illinois University had respondents rate a list of occupations and found that the maximum or minimum ratings occurred on the one presented first regardless of the ordering of the occupations In another study the subjects were asked to rate a beverage on intention to buy on a scale ranging from definitely would not buy to definitely would buy The first beverage tasted was rated significantly higher One of the greatest annoyances in today s gadget filled world is that we continuously manage to misplace them Finding a misplaced remote control smartphone or even our car keys is not only an annoyance but also a time consuming endeavor right A brilliant new invention called Stick N Find will change the way forgetful people live their lives Stick N Finds are about the size of a US quarter with each one containing a circuit board replaceable battery buzzer and LED light The tags can be stuck to items that are frequently lost such as car keys or the TV remote and a custom app allows the tags to be assigned to specific objects When the object is lost accessing the app on the smartphone will display how far away the object is up to feet Then the users can find the missing item by moving in different directions to identify its location The tag will also sound a buzzer or illuminate its LED lights aiding in the search For luggage pets and maybe your kids if you want to make sure they don t wander off too far from home this thing is absolutely perfect So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation In some instances of course there isn t time to slow down and we have to just react But generally we have more time than we allot ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions Slowing down provides time to consider how an issue has been framed and whether we have really considered all the relevant factors We ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider actions that could have serious consequences Putting on the mental brakes can stop you for example from reacting in anger to someone on the road a situation that can lead to danger If more of us would take just a couple extra moments to think an action through we would all be much better off I have always believed your home tells your story That tortoise shell on the wall There was one exactly like it in my mother s house and I can t see it without thinking about a thousand family dinners Those cuff links They belonged to somebody I loved we picked them out on one of the most perfect days we ever spent together Each object tells a story and each story connects us to one another and to the world The truth is things matter They have to They are what we live with and touch each and every day They represent what we have seen who we have loved and where we hope to go next They remind us of the good times and the rough patches and everything in between that has made us who we are According to the experts who are happiest in their careers most people encounter turning points at which they have a clear choice This choice is not as you might think Should I stay or should I go It is often a decision about doing something new on the job a training opportunity an offer to take on new responsibilities a chance to move into a new area with which one is unfamiliar There are a host of possibilities but the experts concur on this one point say yes As far as work is concerned those experts can point to a decision where they were tempted to say no where staying the course was more comfortable and less risky but they finally decided to give it a go Imagine that you are lying on a bed in a dental clinic If you were told only two times more versus only ten times more wouldn t you use different mental strategies to try to cope With either scenario you would pull out the comforting thought of only one more and then it s the last one at different times you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different point information lets us know what internal coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor A simple example you have some minor surgery You are told that on the first post surgical day there is going to be a lot of pain whereas by the second day you will just feel a bit achy Armed with that information you are more likely to plan on watching distracting videos on the first day and to devote day two to writing poems Dozens of studies have demonstrated the nature of self supervision For instance people who were asked to make tricky choices and trade offs such as setting up a wedding registry or ordering a new computer were worse at focusing and solving problems than others who had not made the tough choices In one study some people were asked to restrain their emotions while watching a sad movie about sick animals Afterward they exhibited less physical endurance than others who had let the tears flow freely The research shows that we burn up self control in a wide variety of situations managing the impression we are making on others coping with fears controlling our spending trying to focus on simple instructions such as Don t think of a white bear and many many others Our health is certainly a matter of how we feel but it is a lot more besides We must always factor in An individual may feel fine but if significant others in his or her community keep saying things like You don t seem like yourself or Is there something wrong that person may feel impelled to go to the doctor to get checked out The doctor in turn may perform various tests that indicate that there is indeed something wrong even if the person is as yet experiencing no overt symptoms Once the doctor has confirmed one s friends evaluation that something is wrong the person is very likely to start feeling a lot less lively Contentment is emotionally accepting your present as being what it is without being filled with resentment frustration or irritation at anything you are undergoing But that is thoroughly compatible with You aspire to be better or to accomplish more You are not satisfied to stay where you are existentially with no further growth and no further effects for good on your world You want to be and do more This is the dissatisfaction of aspiration It can be a very healthy goad to personal growth and fulfillment As Saint Augustine put it Be always displeased at what you are if you desire to attain to what you are not If you stand still in vertical rain you will only get wet on top of your head but once you start to move your front starts getting wet as well But crucially Think about it this way in every volume of space there is a certain density of raindrops Your front will meet that density of drops when you get to it no matter what your speed so going more slowly does not help It turns out that real world effects do give runners a small increase in dampness maybe the air currents caused by running suck in more rain than they repel or heavier footsteps cause more splashing but that is a drop in the bucket so to speak compared to the wetness you will prevent by getting to shelter quicker We naturally think in terms of cause and effect And this helps organize our experience of the world We think of ourselves as seeing some things cause other things to happen but in terms of our raw sense experience we just see certain things happen before other things and remember having seen such before and after sequences at earlier times For example a rock hits a window and then the window breaks We don t see a third thing called causation But we believe it has happened The rock hitting the window caused it to break But this is not experienced like the flight of the rock or the shattering of the glass Experience does not seem to force the concept of causation on us We just use it to interpret what we experience Cause and effect are categories that could never be read out of our experience and must therefore be to attribute such a connection In the case of a company it is common to describe culture as the visible elements of a working environment casual Fridays or free sodas in the cafeteria But as MIT s Edgar Schein explains those things don t define a culture They are just artifacts of it According to him culture is a way of working together toward common goals that people have followed so frequently and so successfully that they don t even think about trying to do things another way If a culture has formed people will autonomously do what they need to do to be successful Those instincts are not formed overnight Rather they are the result of shared learning In every organization there is that first time when a problem or challenge arises Those responsible reach a decision together on what to do and how to do it in order to succeed If that decision results in a successful outcome then the next time when those employees face a similar type of challenge they will return to the same decision and same way of solving the problem As long as the way they have chosen keeps working to solve the problem the culture will become an internal set of rules that people will draw upon in making the choices ahead of them They will just assume that the way they have been doing it is the way of doing it This causes an organization to become Managers don t need to enforce the rule People instinctively get on with what needs to be done  Annie what a great picture you ve made What is it What s wrong with this reaction to a child s drawing You re obviously interested and it sounds encouraging to your ears But this kind of praise can actually have the opposite effect Generalized praise like great picture isn t as meaningful to children as finding something specific about their performance or behavior I like the bright colors you used in your picture is more effective than great picture If you say That s nice dear without looking at what your child is trying to show you it could affect her self esteem Specific praise gives her confidence in your interest and lets her know you really care If you re too busy to do laundry don t worry about it At least your jeans will stay clean depending on your definition of clean After wearing a pair of unwashed jeans for fifteen months Josh Le a student at the University of Alberta handed them to Dr McQueen a textile scientist She sampled the bacteria living on the jeans Next Le washed the jeans He wore the jeans for only two weeks this time and Dr McQueen took a sample again The results Whether fifteen months or two weeks the bacteria growth was about the same Now what about the smell Le did air out his jeans three times a week and he reportedly still had lots of friends It wasn t until after a m that an airplane started to run down the runway toward the ocean for takeoff The airport was just a mile from the beautiful white sand beach The plane was only in the air for a few seconds before there was a loud bang Flames came out from one of the engines The people in the control tower heard the pilot say I m coming back around Then there were two more explosions The plane went off the radar screen in the control tower When the police arrived at the scene more than half of the plane had already sunk into the ocean Imagine you want to write a book You can usually type words in an hour working on your book This goes well for the first hours and you type words per hour However at the third hour you feel tired and you only type words That s words less than your usual output Output decreases over time when there are no breaks is important Taking time off recharges your batteries so you can sprint forward when you return to work Refresh and renew yourself your body mind and spirit Then get back to work Who would have thought years ago that a box made out of plastic and glass would ruin the manners of millions of people We know about the digital miracles brought by the smartphone But one of its biggest influences on our lives is the sudden breaking of standards of etiquette in less than a decade These days many smartphone owners check Twitter during a conversation and do not consider it impolite This usually takes place while someone else is talking a friend colleague or boss Younger smartphone users even have learned the art of texting one person while they themselves are talking to another Some scientists believe that certain animals use a type of language For example vervet monkeys have different sounds for different predators When an alarm call is given the monkeys know what predators eagles leopards or snakes are approaching However the monkeys aren t born knowing the meaning of each of these sounds Young monkeys learn the meaning of the sounds from listening to and watching older monkeys This learning takes some time After young monkeys learn the alarm call for seeing an eagle they use it whenever they see a large bird even if the bird is harmless Only after much trial and error do they realize that the eagle callWhen we design experiments we usually For example let s say a farmer wants to know what kind of plowing method is better The farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them He changes how he plows his fields Everything else will be the same on both fields the type of crop he grows the amount of water that he uses and the slope of the fields he plants on The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight If the farmer only changes how he plows his fields he can see the impact of the one change After the experiment is complete the farmer can conclude which plowing method is better In most cases sound reaches the ear through the air but air is not the only medium through which sound is carried When we make a loud noise it will frighten fish and cause them to swim away So we conclude that the sound must have reached them through the water An Indian puts his ear to the ground in order to detect distant footsteps Such sounds are comparatively clear when they are carried through the earth Similarly a gentle tapping at one end of a long table can be clearly heard at the opposite end if the ear is pressed against the table From these facts we can see thatPeople want their problems solved Questions like What s the problem and What are we going to do about this are important But whether they say it or not people often need some acknowledgment of feelings before they can move on to the conversation for problem solving Too often in difficult conversations we skip right to problem solving without acknowledging our partners feelings You re working too hard says your wife When was the last time we had dinner together You realize she s right and say Well for the next month my workload is a lot lighter I ll make an effort to be home every night by six o clock Your wife doesn t seem satisfied and you are left wondering what more you could have said But your wife s complaint is not a math problem You may think you ve solved the problem but her invisible questions haven t been answered Problem solving is important but it has to wait matters Your wife wants her feelings acknowledged first Saying It s been a tough time these last few months hasn t it or It sounds like you re feeling lonely would be more appropriate If children were required to excel only in certain areas they might be better able to cope with their parents expectations Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we make unfair genetic demands on our teens It is the only period in your life when you re expected to do all things well Adults don t hold themselves to those standards We don t interview the dentist about whether he can throw a basketball or quiz our accountant on biology before we let her do our taxes In elementary and high school we celebrate the generalist but in the real world there is no room for the generalist except on a quiz show We should not expect too much from our children We need to be careful when we use general terms to identify groups In some cases they make distinctions among the subgroups unclear For example people from both Guatemala and Mexico may be described as Latinos However their cultural backgrounds vary on several important dimensions so we should not view them as being from a homogeneous group Similarly the term Asian American blurs variations among people whose heritage is for example Chinese Korean or Japanese Whenever the subgroups have been identified we will use the more specific terms When we use the more general terms remember that they may not apply to all subgroups within the group described by the more general terms Sometimes we find a piece of writing hard to understand and we need to make the meaning clear which is possible through simulation A classic example is car insurance people They read the reports of accidents and have to figure out who is legally responsible for the accidents While nowadays they probably use computer simulation at one time they would use toy cars and drawings of the roads They would move the toy cars and note the damage that would occur according to the reports from the drivers making claims In this case the simulation makes the written material more understandable by presenting it in a visual way To study a text better you can use simulation with any convenient objects No one else can experience the way your heart feels about things No one can see through the lens you use to see life quite the same as you do Accept this Honor and praise it too Do not be quick to compromise it In your desire to fit in or make others happy you may be tempted to pretend to be someone you are not You may even pretend to believe things you don t really believe or act in ways that are out of character with who you really are When you do this you lose out on the real you The world loses out on you too Strive to be a healthy happy and enlightened person and then taking your place alongside your fellow travelers offer your self to the waiting world Many of the biggest stars in sports are tough to deal with and rarely does an agent develop a connection with them during the first encounter The most important lesson I learned as a sports agent is that it isn t just about signing a million dollar contract When I am working with a client there are hundreds of little things that take place during the weeks before we are ready to sit down and negotiate Small stuff plays a big part in how satisfied and comfortable my clients are with me and my services I often express interest in their recent vacation or how their children are doing in school Paying attention to is a huge sign of respect to today s top athletes One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory loss is the tendency to when things do not go well Here is a good example Jane a woman in her mid sixties recently got a call from her son who asked her to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor s visit A couple of days later the son called and asked Jane if she had gotten the bus pass She said with some guilt Oh no I m sorry I forgot all about that Her son s response was Well Mom I asked you to do that just two days ago Jane ended the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself she shouldn t have forgotten what her son had asked But her forgetfulness was not her fault She could not control the memory loss Cell phones seem to have achieved the status of of all the electronic consumer products The average person in America and Britain throws away his or her cell phone within eighteen months of purchase even though cell phones will last for ten years on average Every year more than million still working cell phones in the United States and million in Britain are retired Only a small fraction of them are reassembled for reuse or exported to foreign countries This trend isn t limited to both countries Many other advanced countries have also seen new types of cell phones replacing old ones almost annually Back in the th century trains weren t so easy to stop Engineers didn t just step on the brakes instead brakemen manually adjusted the speed with brake wheels on the roof of the cars Working on top of a moving train took concentration Cars rocked violently the wind roared past and brakemen had to jump from car to car at top speeds Often they were so intensely focused that they forgot to watch for upcoming tunnels or bridges You can imagine what happened when a brakeman didn t duck That s where telltales a series of ropes hung over the tracks came in Hung from about feet from tunnels and low hanging bridges the ropes would brush across the heads of brakemen to In Roy H William s book Free the Beagle he asks readers to imagine that their left brain is a lawyer and their right brain is the lawyer s pet beagle The beagle runs over and drops something at the feet of the lawyer The lawyer says I don t have time to play right now I m trying to concentrate But the beagle was bringing the lawyer a clue to help him with his work but the beagle cannot speak and explain his gift Unfortunately the lawyer doesn t realize the significance of the beagle s gift He thinks that his intellect is enough to solve the problem and ignores the beagle s assistance The left brain thinks like the lawyer The left brain has an ego Don t ever let anyone convince you that though because if that is true half of your brain exists for no reason at all What a delicious feeling it must be to get up in the morning with nothing to do To most of us it is a treat that comes very few times after childhood just a day or two in the year There is no need to go off on a long tour to climb mountains and to sail on rivers We are able to sleep as long as we like in the morning to dress as leisurely as we please and then to go down quietly through the day having absolutely nothing to do but to please ourselves It is the very extreme of pleasure to lie down beneath an old oak tree upon a breezy hill and hear the wind rustling among the leaves Moreover the idle days are not We have time to think of other people when the general strain is relaxed We grow pitiful towards our hard worked brothers and sisters and think how happy it would make us to see them all with nothing to do for a few days Of course many of them would soon get tired of it but surely it would be helpful to make them feel glad to start their work again about which they have complained three hundred days of every year Let as many of us as possible take this great pleasure of nothing to do for a day or two at least We shall go back to our work happily after it One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the wrong time to start whatever our project is and we should wait until the time is right Tim Ferriss author of the bestselling book The H our Workweek has this to say about timing For all the most important things the timing is always wrong Waiting for a good time to quit your job The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time Conditions are never perfect Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you If it s important to you and you want to do it eventually just do it and correct course along the way If you wait for the timing to be right before you make a move you may never make a move at all The biggest game changer in our future is life prolongation It works for mice and worms and surely it will work for the rest of us some day Biologists are now tinkering with so called anti aging substances trying to get you the benefit of life prolongation But life gets its edge from the possibility of its ending What will life be like when we live forever No one dies No one gets older No more evolution No need to hurry If you want something done give it to a busy man but nobody needs to be busy when you have forever Who is going to do the real work then Chosen people who will volunteer or be volunteered to be mortal Life without death changes absolutely everything If we want things to stay as they are then things will have to change  In Western culture playing the masculine role has traditionally required traits such as independence assertiveness and dominance Females are expected to be more nurturing and sensitive to other people Are these masculine and feminine roles universal Could biological differences between the sexes lead inevitably to gender differences in behavior In anthropologist Margaret Mead compared the gender roles adopted by people in three tribal societies on the island of New Guinea and her observations are certainly thought provoking In the Arapesh tribe both men and women were taught to play what we would regard as a feminine role They were cooperative non aggressive and sensitive to the needs of others Both men and women of the Mundugumor tribe were brought up to be aggressive and emotionally unresponsive to other people a masculine pattern of behavior by Western standards Finally the Tchambuli tribe displayed a pattern of gender role development that was the direct opposite of the Western pattern Males were passive emotionally dependent and socially sensitive whereas females were dominant independent and assertive  The relationship between physical products and individual ownership is undergoing a profound evolution We don t want the CD we want the music it plays We don t want the disc we want the storage it holds We don t want the answering machine we want the messages it saves We don t want the DVD we want the movie it carries In other words we want not the stuff but the needs or experiences it fulfills As our possessions dematerialize into the intangible our preconceptions of ownership are changing creating a dotted line between what s mine what s yours and what s ours This shift is fueling a world where has more value than possession and as Kevin Kelly a founder of Wired magazine puts it where access is better than ownership  Scientists and educators have long sought to understand the emergence of expertise artistic and otherwise Many researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can simply come down to Studies of eminent scientists in the s supported this view by underscoring the individuals capacity for endurance concentration and commitment to effortful practice Benjamin Bloom an education psychologist wrote in that none of his subjects achieved expertise without a supportive environment and a long and intensive period of training This education came first from encouraging instructors and later from demanding master teachers A few years later psychologist K Anders Ericsson of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in piano violin chess or athletics The investigations revealed that a person s level of achievement correlated strongly with the amount of practice put in  In the command and control management model plans were considered destiny Top management formulated exacting plans for every aspect of operations and then kept everything under tight control to meet the plan All too often however plans were derailed by unanticipated events Planning is no longer the exclusive domain of top management it now typically involves those who carry out the plans because they are closer to the customer Planning experts who recommend strategic agility say managers need to to take advantage of opportunities A good analogy of this would be an improvisational comedy act The stand up comic has a plan for the introduction structure of the act some tried and true jokes and closing remarks Within this planned framework the comic will play off the audience s input and improvise as necessary Let s think about flipping a coin If you get ten heads in a row what is the likelihood that the next flip will be heads Don t be fooled it s percent the same as it is on any single coin flip Most people think the chances of getting heads will actually be lower than percent the opposite of momentum They know they should see roughly the same number of heads as tails so they feel that if they have seen ten heads in a row they are due for a tails A tails has to emerge But it doesn t There is no law of averages If the process is random there is no predictability This is also what drives the gambler s fallacy Gamblers on losing streaks erroneously believe they are due for a win and keep gambling thinking that their luck But if the whole thing is random you aren t due for anything Your chances haven t changed at all If you have ever had a sip of the bitters you would probably frown just thinking about it According to a study from researchers at Brooklyn College the horrible taste does more than that Researchers had fifty seven students rate their moral distaste for several morally dubious acts such as politicians taking bribes students cheating on tests and the like Before they started rating the acts the students drank shots of one of three drinks bitter tasting liquid sweet beverage or water On a point scale with being the worst rating for a morally reprehensible act the students who drank the bitter liquid gave the acts an average rating of those who drank the sweet beverage gave an average of and the water group gave an average of The ratings of the sweet beverage and water groups were statistically the same but the bitter liquid group rating was significantly higher This study suggests that the bad taste When a certain word which is to be defined crops up in its own definition we call it a circular definition The point of defining a term is to explain its meaning this obviously cannot be achieved if you need already to understand the meaning of the term in order to understand the definition For example to define stress as the physiological and psychological responses to stressful situations would be to give a circular definition This is because stressful situations are presumably only recognizable from the fact that they tend to produce stress but the meaning of stress is the very thing which someone requesting the definition is seeking to understand and so should not be presupposed in the definition To define philosophy as the activity carried out by philosophers would be another example of a circular definition  For years Switzerland had been trying to find a place to store radioactive nuclear waste One location designated as a potential nuclear waste site was the small village of Wolfenschiessen In some economists surveyed the residents of the village asking whether they would vote to accept a nuclear waste repository if the Swiss parliament decided to build it there Although the facility was widely viewed as an undesirable addition to the neighborhood a slim majority percent of residents said they would accept it Apparently their sense of civic duty outweighed their concern about the risks Then the economists added a sweetener suppose parliament offered to compensate each resident with an annual monetary payment Then would you favor it The result support went down not up Adding the financial incentive cut the rate of acceptance in half from to percent Even when the economists increased the monetary offer the result was unchanged Why would more people accept nuclear waste for free than for pay Standard economic analysis suggests that offering people money to accept a burden would increase not decrease their willingness to do so But the economists who led the study point out that the price effect is sometimes invalidated by For villagers willingness to accept the nuclear waste site reflected public spirit a recognition that the country as a whole depended on nuclear energy and that the nuclear waste had to be stored somewhere Against the background of this civic commitment the offer of cash to residents of the village felt like a bribe an effort to buy their vote Last Memorial Day I was invited to my cousin s house for a barbecue The last thing I wanted to do was spend hours in traffic So I decided to take a different route I traveled the back roads instead of the highway My family and I enjoyed the scenery and there was hardly any traffic A simple change in route changed our whole day When we do the same old thing the same old way for too long we become bored and boredom fosters bad attitudes Try something new at least once a day It doesn t have to be anything major Even a small disruption in the routine can create a fresh approach and a new way of looking at things  Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long Your frog is your biggest most important task It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment If you have many important tasks before you start with the biggest hardest and most important task first Discipline yourself to begin immediately and then persist until the task is complete before you go on to something else Are you a forgetful student Do you often experience headaches Then perhaps you just need to increase your water intake to revive your brain function It is known that of our brain tissue is water Hence water is a vital component for the smooth function of our brain And according to research if a person s body is short of water his brain releases a hormone called cortisol that has a shrinkage effect to the brain which then decreases its memory power Inadequate water in the brain is also the culprit of being forgetful restless and slow Headaches are also more frequent when our brain lacks water So never ever let yourself get thirsty because you are making your brain shrink become restless and forgetful  The founding population of our direct ancestors is not thought to have been much larger than individuals some think the group was as small as a few hundred How then did we go from such a fragile minority population to a tide of humanity billion strong and growing There is only one way according to Richard Potts You give up on You don t try to beat back the changes You begin not to care about consistency within a given habitat because such consistency isn t an option You adapt to variation itself It was a brilliant strategy Instead of learning how to survive in just one or two ecological environments we took on the entire globe The major change in mapping in the past decade as opposed to in the previous to years is that mapping has become It s not the map itself that has changed You would recognize a map and the latest modern map as having almost the same look But the old map was a fixed piece of paper the same for everybody who looked at it The new map is different for everyone who uses it You can drag it where you want to go you can zoom in as you wish you can switch modes traffic satellite you can fly across your town even ask questions about restaurants and directions So a map has gone from a fixed stylized portrait of the Earth to a dynamic interactive conversation about your use of the Earth As parents of multiple children know there is no one simple formula for meeting a baby s needs From birth each baby has a unique personality and preferences Each baby s nervous system is unique as well Some babies might be calmed by noise and activity whereas others might prefer quiet The key is to learn what your baby needs and respond to them accordingly Even though all of the sounds and cries may sound the same at first your baby is communicating with you in different ways using sound and movement An arched back eyes tightly closed fists curled up rubbing eyes all of these signs communicate something specific about your baby s emotional and physical state Your task is to become a n and find out what your baby is communicating and how best to respond Jupiter is here In the early hours of September an astronomer in Oregon spotted a bright flash of light on Jupiter Astronomers believe this brilliant burst to be an asteroid hitting the giant planet Scientists say that the asteroid may have been heading for Earth but instead Jupiter took the blow And this may not be the first time Jupiter has saved Earth from being hit Jupiter has the strongest gravitational pull of any planet The gravitational pull of Jupiter grabs passing asteroids and pulls them to its surface and away from Earth The impacts are leading scientists to study possible marks from asteroids on Jupiter Chances of actually hitting Earth are very unlikely but scientists keep a close watch on asteroids as there are so many of them in orbit Psychologists distinguish between two types of stress good stress called eustress and bad stress called distress Many people would probably be surprised that stress can benefit you and your body but that is exactly what eustress does This is not only good for you it is actually designed When humans encounter a dangerous circumstance their breathing becomes faster their heart rate increases and their throat and nose muscles open up to allow more air to get to the lungs This physical reaction prepares the body either to fight the danger or to escape it For example if you were alone on the street and encountered a stranger late at night your body might prepare your heart and lungs to help you run away as quickly as possible from the danger Without eustress you would never get this head start Teachers at Stone Mountain State College S M S C give higher grades than teachers at other colleges in the state college system More than one third of the undergraduate grades awarded in the spring semester were A s and only percent were F s The percentage of A s awarded to graduate students was even higher almost two thirds were A s The students of course may be happy because they received high grades However evidence suggests that this trend is When they applied to a graduate or professional school they got disadvantages because the admission offices believed an A from S M S C is not equal to an A from other universities Grade inflation therefore may hurt a student from S M S C who intends to apply to a graduate or professional school  Leaders and managers used to be told to keep a stiff upper lip and not show emotion to remove emotion from the situation at hand and just deal with the facts Despite all your efforts to mask emotions they will come out in some form and people have an innate ability to pick up on this Emotions are always at play so we need to reframe the role that emotions play in the workplace We need to view emotions as the fuel that drives the engine of productivity and innovation The reality is that you will never separate emotions from your workplace Individuals who are good at dealing with the tough stuff are those who have learned and even mastered the art of managing emotions So instead of spending time in trying to push aside or suppress emotions it is far better to learn how to manage them well In numerous experiments conducted mostly at Brandeis University psychologist Theresa Amabile sought the conditions that might influence creativity In a typical experiment she would ask the participants to produce some creative product Depending on the experiment the product might be a poem or a short story In the experiment Amabile would tell some of the participants that their products were going to be evaluated for creativity by a panel of experts Other participants were told nothing about evaluation or about any consequences The results of these experiments were quite consistent The participants who made the most creative products were those who did not know that their products would be evaluated They were the ones just playing not concerned about judgments  A few years ago I received a surprise birthday present from a friend a tandem skydive Falling through the sky fifteen thousand feet from the ground was never on my wish list All the same that was exactly what I was about to do My friend initially intended for the skydive to be a surprise However my friend decided it might be wise to let me get used to the idea of jumping from a plane in advance so that I could prepare emotionally Entering the words skydiving and perish on Google revealed that approximately thirty people die every year in the United States while skydiving This may seem a large number at first however considering the million jumps every year it is in fact a small percentage Although I had experienced three days of stressful anticipation having that time allowed me to acquire knowledge regarding the threatening event My fear was reduced by the information I had gathered allowing me to enjoy the experience more  A new study suggests that influence our experience of the food People perceived yogurt as denser and more expensive when eaten with lighter spoons the researchers report today in the journal Flavour probably because those spoons matched their expectations But yogurt tasted with that spoon was also rated as less sweet than when eaten with heavier or larger spoons And the people thought yogurt tasted sweeter when they ate it with a white spoon than with a black one In a final experiment with different types of cheese the researchers found that people rated cheese as saltier when they sampled it with a knife insead of a fork spoon or toothpick This may have been because eating with a knife is an unusual behavior the researchers speculated or because it reminded people of using a knife to try samples in a cheese shop where cheeses tend to be more aged and therefore saltier People make purchasing decisions by choosing between alternatives or by rejecting certain options But a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research finds that focusing on rejecting an option can lead consumers to their preferences Why does this happen When consumers reject options they need to decide which alternative they do not want so they focus on options that are less preferred in order to assess if they should reject those options This shift of focus makes them more likely to notice appealing features of the initially less preferred option For example a newly married couple who prefers an apartment closer to the subway station because of easy access to it but doesn t have enough money was told to select an apartment to reject an apartment closer to the subway station or a less expensive one farther from the station Simply instructing them to decide which one they would like to reject makes them more likely to choose the less expensive apartment as their place to live in Similarly those who said they would prefer a less expensive apartment selected the apartment close to the station With old friends you can argue about politics tell informal jokes and reveal sensitive personal facts With new coworkers though you probably avoid discussions of politics tell only the cleanest jokes and avoid lots of highly personal topics Over time you may overhear jokes told by colleagues and get a sense of what type of humor is appropriate in your workplace Chances are though that when you tell jokes of your own to the group you will keep your topics well within the borders defined by the jokes you have heard told by your colleagues That is the first jokes you hear told by your colleagues help When you tell a joke of your own you are testing that belief The safest way to test that belief is to stick within the range of what you already believe to be acceptable Have you ever noticed that you sometimes lean forward when someone you re talking with leans forward The Chameleon Effect is the unintentional physical and verbal mirroring between people who are getting along well People may mimic each others body posture hand gestures speaking accents and other behaviors when they are in rapport The body is actually autonomously making the interaction smoother and increasing the level of liking while communicating The experiment conducted by Tanya Chartrand and her colleague showed that mimicry facilitated the smoothness of interactions and increased liking between interaction partners Experimenters saw an increase in a subject s behavior such as shaking their foot when they shook their foot during an interaction When experimenters intentionally copied the mannerisms of a subject the subject reported Empathic individuals those who took the perspective of others were also found to mirror another person s action more often Before a person can overcome self esteem problems and build healthy self esteem it helps to know what might cause them Obviously self esteem can be hurt when someone whose acceptance is important like a parent or teacher constantly puts you down But criticism doesn t have to come from other people Self esteem can also Some teens have an inner critic a voice inside that seems to find fault with everything they do And people sometimes unintentionally model their inner voice after a critical parent or someone else whose opinion is important to them Over time listening to a negative inner voice can harm a person s self esteem just as much as if the criticism were coming from another person Some people get so used to their inner critic being there that they don t even notice when they re putting themselves down There is an interesting phenomenon where people are perceived as possessing a trait that they describe in others Telling others that your math professor is lazy will cause them to infer that you are lazy This works the other way too describing positive attributes about your friend may ascribe you those attributes as well Several experiments showed that people will associate personality traits to communicators mindlessly without logical rationale They also have a poor recollection of whether the communicator was describing themselves or someone else in a conversation So be careful when gossiping about a co worker or you might be seen as what you describe And if you want to appear more charming perhaps you could add that word to your vocabulary when talking about others Furthermore maybe it would be a good idea to keep your negative thoughts to yourself As the old saying goes We tell friends about our new clothing purchases and show family members what we re sending to the local newspaper This desire to share our thoughts opinions and experiences is one reason social media and online social networks have become so popular People blog about their preferences post Facebook status updates about what they ate for lunch and tweet about why they hate the current government As many observers have commented today s social network addicted people cannot seem to stop sharing what they think like and want with everyone all the time Indeed research finds that more than percent of what people talk about is their personal experiences or personal relationships Similarly around half of tweets are me focused covering what people are doing now or something that has happened to them Why do people talk so much about their own attitudes and experiences It s more than just vanity we re actually wired to find it pleasurable Harvard neuroscientists Jason Mitchell and Diana Tamir found that information about the self is intrinsically rewarding In one study Mitchell and Tamir hooked subjects up to brain scanners and asked them to share either their own opinions and attitudes I like snowboarding or the opinions and attitudes of another person He likes puppies They found that sharing personal opinions activated the same brain circuits that respond to rewards like food and money So talking about what you did this weekend might feel just as good as taking a delicious bite of double chocolate cake Common wisdom states If it tastes good it s not good for you It also says If you get to eat the foods you like you re not dieting There is no evidence to support these claims In fact many diets fail due to this attitude When dieting there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna water and protein powder in a blender for lunch His idea was that food didn t need to taste good what really mattered was getting nutrients That mentality may work for some But if you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull or that they can t ever eat what they like you are setting them up for failure Flavor in the diet helps to ensure success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your calorie budget The psychological advice warns us most often about the limits of argumentation in dealing with another person and the truth at the same time As Sir Thomas Browne once warned in all disputes the more passion there is the less purpose there is Debate you often hear typically generates more heat than light Passion clouds reason And in the context of an interpersonal argument or debate people sometimes are willing to do anything to save face Joseph Addison once observed Our rivals in debates put me in the mind of the cuttlefish that when he is unable to protect himself blackens the water about him till he becomes invisible So as Publilius Syrus concluded long ago in a heated argument we are apt to lose sight of the truth There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for our dilemma about how to live history I believe that the future of the art of living can be found by gazing into the past If we explore how people have lived in other epochs and cultures we can draw out lessons for the challenges and opportunities of everyday life What secrets for living with passion lie in medieval attitudes towards death or in the pin factories of the industrial revolution How might an encounter with Ming dynasty China or Central African indigenous culture change our views about bringing up our kids and caring for our parents It is astonishing that until now we have made so little effort to unveil this wisdom from the past which is based on how people have actually lived rather than utopian dreamings of what might be possible The person who relates to certain individuals as family members or friends to the exclusion of others does not affirm that those to whom he relates are better persons He affirms only that they are his relatives or friends When a new father tells his two week old daughter that she is the cutest little girl in town he is not informing the infant that she would win a beauty contest of girls of her age before a fair panel of judges He is more than anything else telling her that she is his little girl The same is true in general when people assert that their spouses their parents and their sons and daughters are the best The highest praises are used to indicate that certain persons Some social critics would argue that the move toward an increasingly isolated individualism had been underway for some time at least since the middle of the twentieth century when psychoanalysis had infused the ideal of individual self making with a new psychological component Emotional well being the subjective experience of happiness and the pursuit of pleasure rather than say the accumulation of wealth community involvement and moral virtue began to be equated with success This focus on self fulfillment constituted a departure from the traditional criteria for evaluating success While the self made man of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries aimed to achieve success in terms that were largely external and measurable for example accumulation of wealth status or power late twentieth century self making involves the pursuit of the rather more elusive and variable state of self fulfillment With the emergence of an emphasis on self fulfillment one finds there is no end point for self making individuals canUntil J K Rowling s Harry Potter series set in motion an extraordinary child to adult crossover craze that took the entire world by storm books generally crossed over in the opposite direction Children In fact this type of readership transgression has been going on almost as long as books have existed Many of the world s great classics were appropriated very early on by children even though they were not written with young readers in mind Some works very quickly assumed the status of crossover works A number of them became almost the sole property of children a prime example being Daniel Defoe s Robinson Crusoe which is read by children around the world but very rarely by adults in any country First published in Defoe s most celebrated work was not meant for children but became a classic of children s literature and inspired countless adaptations and edited versions Horseshoe crabs have copper in their blood that makes the blood turn royal blue in the air The odd colored blood has an amazing trait It detects bacteria germs and forms a clot In the s scientists invented a test using horseshoe blood to detect endotoxins the chemical poisons some bacteria make in human medicines Just a tiny amount of endotoxins in a person s bloodstream can cause dangerous fevers and even death To test if a drug is clean of bacteria or endotoxins the drug is mixed with an extract from horseshoe blood called Limulus lysate If a jellylike clot forms the drug is not safe The Limulus lysate test is quick and can detect even the tiniest amount of endotoxins It is used worldwide to check if medicines blood donations and medical supplies are clean and safe Every year the extraordinary blue bloods No animal surpasses humans in and we ve been doing it for a long time The Iceman whose year old corpse was discovered on a glacier on the Italian Austrian border had stuffed grasses into his shoes to keep his feet warm and was carrying a sloe berry Human transport of plants increased abundantly as our transportation technology developed People transported and introduced some non native species intentionally for food fiber medicine ornament or scientific curiosity Seeds of other plants were introduced accidentally in sacks of seed grain wool or cotton or in mud stuck to machinery Human activities like farming irrigation forestry and mining have made it easier for these non native species to become established by removing native vegetation disturbing the soil and altering the availability of water and nutrients Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of nomadic culture It emerged in the nineteenth century in response to a variety of social forces First the Romantic movement encouraged communing with the beauties of nature while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider who rebelled against organized society According to the historians of camping Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy works like Friedrich Schiller s The Robbers and George Borrow s nineteenth century gypsy tales the gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple heroic life under the stars contemptuous of settled town dwellers in their dull comfort A second influence was the age of empire European powers in Africa and Asia were busy trekking into the dark wilderness pitching their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands Camping was necessary for colonial expansion and became a way of life not only for the troops but for the explorers and missionaries A final factor was the rise of emigration Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia the United States Canada and South Africa working as trappers lumberjacks and ranchers or lured by the gold rushes A specialist industry grew up to supply their needs tents camp beds stoves kettles camp matches and coffee Their tales of rough adventure were soon popularized in the press back home Camping was becoming part of the cultural imagination  While most experts say eight hours of sleep is ideal the truth is it all depends on how you feel Some people do well with seven hours or less while others require nine or more to be at their best If you are ill or under tremendous stress you will probably need to sleep longer than you usually do The best indicator of how much sleep you need should be based on how you feel Keep in mind that sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking that we re getting enough sleep If you are getting sufficient sleep you should feel refreshed and not have trouble getting out of bed in the morning What Hippocratic ideas are still in practice today Even though Hippocrates lived nearly years ago many of his ideas sound very familiar today He would inquire about the family health history to see if any relatives had suffered from similar diseases He asked questions about the patient s home to see if his or her environment might be causing the illness He discovered that diet played an important role in preventing disease Hippocrates was the first to understand the physical illness caused by emotional stress He even made suggestions on what we call bedside manner He said physicians should pay as much attention to the comfort and welfare of the patient as to the disease itself One of the ways to identify your values is to look at what frustrates or upsets you Anger often indicates an ignored value or a misdirected passion Think of specific times when you were mad or frustrated What about these situations upset you most Write down your descriptions of them To find your values reflect on the words or phrases you ve written to focus on what s most important to you For example if you get annoyed when someone asks you about something he could figure out for himself perhaps you value resourcefulness independence or taking care of oneself Consider how running yoga and weight lifting Running improves aerobic capacity which in turn will enhance your endurance when weight lifting or through a long yoga class The increased flexibility from yoga will lengthen your running stride allowing you to run smoother and faster Your improved flexibility will also increase your range of motion while weight lifting which in turn will make your muscles stronger Lifting weights increases muscle strength which will make you a stronger runner and improve your endurance and balance when maintaining difficult yoga postures All of these activities reinforce one another and the total benefit is much greater than the sum of its parts People may or may not remember what you said or did but they will always remember Have you ever noticed when people enter a room they bring a type of energy with them For example you re at your office talking with someone when another person approaches you and you get a feeling of Oh great I m so glad he s coming Or maybe it s a feeling of Oh man he s coming over here Let me get out of here before he comes because he s either going to say something I don t like or try to make me feel inferior What energy do you carry when you enter a room Are you a person who brightens up the room Or are you bringing in storm clouds People are loyal to their e mail There appears to be an unwritten expectation that you are accessible and available so if someone sends you something you will read it understand it and respond immediately That s the deal And when you break the deal you are not a team player you are not competent and something is wrong with you Every day and sometimes constantly throughout the day you have to check your e mail Why You may have received an e mail that if left unopened will have an impact on how you are perceived E mail has become a n It says Read me feed me do what I say It demands our attention directs our work and has a controlling presence in our lives Ethical decision making requires us to look beyond the immediate moment and beyond personal needs and desires to imagine the possible consequences of our choices and behavior on self and others In its most elemental sense moral imagination is about in our interactions with others In some sense moral imagination is a dramatic virtual rehearsal that allows us to examine different courses of action to determine the morally best thing to do The capacity for empathy is crucial to moral imagination As we have no immediate experience of what others feel we can have no idea of how they are affected Only by conceiving what we ourselves would feel in the situation can we understand how they feel Humans who lived as hunter gatherers more than years ago fitted into ecosystems by acting as predators and on occasion they probably also served as prey The role of humans in today s ecosystems differs from that of early human settlements Today humans in almost every part of the world People have detached themselves from most ecosystems Modern humans also tend to negatively affect ecosystems in ways that the earliest civilizations did not One aspect of the study of ecosystems in environmental science provides a clue as to how disconnected humans have become from nature Many ecosystems are named for the dominant species within them Therefore the world contains coral reef ecosystems evergreen forest ecosystems grassland ecosystems and so on but environmental science contains no human ecosystems Let s think about waiting in line Whether you re at a bank supermarket or amusement park waiting in line is probably not your idea of fun Consider the almost universal motivation to get through the line as quickly as possible Under what circumstances would you be willing to let another person cut in front of you in the line Small changes in the way that requests are made can often lead to some startlingly big results But is it possible that just a single word from a requester could drastically increase the likelihood that you d say Yes go ahead Yes and the single word is because Behavioral scientist Ellen Langer and her colleagues decided to put the of this word to the test In one study Langer arranged for a stranger to approach someone waiting in line to use a photocopier and simply ask Excuse me I have five pages May I use the copy machine Faced with this direct request to cut ahead in the line percent of the people were willing to agree to allow the stranger to go ahead of them However when the stranger made the request with a reason May I use the copy machine because I m in a rush percent of the people said yes After all providing a solid reason for the request justifies asking to jump ahead When was the last time you dreamed I m not talking about what went down last night while you were sleeping I m talking about really letting your mind think over something major you want to make happen in your life Can t remember Don t have time for such follies You need to change that starting today Sounds obvious but the first step toward making a dream come true is to actually have a dream At some point in your life you probably wanted something with your whole heart and it didn t happen And that hurt You might have stopped dreaming Maybe you didn t do it consciously but you began to avoid letting yourself go after scary goals It s a universal occurrence it happens to almost everyone But you can overcome this common limitation and start dreaming again Many predators direct their initial attack at the head of their prey Some prey species have taken advantage of this tendency by evolving false heads located at their posterior end Individuals of the species Thecla togarna for example possess a false head with dummy antennae at the tips of their hindwings Upon landing the butterfly moves its hindwings and thereby the dummy antennae up and down while keeping the true antennae motionless Thecla togarna s second trick occurs at the instant of landing when the butterfly quickly turns so that its false head points in the direction of previous flight An approaching predator is thus confronted with a prey that flutters off in the direction opposite to that expected Experimental tests have demonstrated that markings associated with false heads misdirect the attacks of avian predators and increase the possibility of escape of the prey There is no way that we two legged creatures can keep up with many four legged animals in a head to head sprint but in recent years some anthropologists have suggested that the human species has evolved in such a way as to be built for marathon running Researchers from Harvard University and the University of Utah point to our long legs and short arms as being suited to running necessary for our early hunter gatherer lifestyle on the African savannah More specifically the scientists highlight the abundance of tendons in our legs used little in walking but essential for running our large leg joints for shock absorption and our relative lack of body hair for minimizing rises in body temperatures These characteristics demonstrate that the human body as a whole is comparatively well suited to endurance running compared to other animals It is not a new idea that cooking is an activity that humans In the Scottish writer James Boswell noting that no beast is a cook called Homo sapiens the cooking animal Fifty years later in The Physiology of Taste the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin claimed that cooking made us who we are by teaching men to use fire it had done the most to advance the cause of civilization More recently L vi Strauss writing in The Raw and the Cooked in reported that many of the world s cultures entertained a similar view regarding cooking as the symbolic activity that establishes the difference between animals and people When we begin each book we roll up our sleeves and do everything we can to ease students into academic reading This means that we frame the text before students read it We provide a specific purpose for reading each chapter We design close readings that enable kids to explore more deeply than surface level reading We model to students how we would read the text About halfway through the novel we should begin to step out of the process and begin requiring our students to take the journey on their own Teachers should not hold the hands of their students all the way through the novel If the front half of the book is taught properly students should be equipped to read the second half of the book with much less assistance from the instructor Students should be encouraged to Consider the power of a baseball bat All the energy gained by the bat is supplied by the batter The bat is just an instrument that helps send the ball on its way If it does its job well then we usually say that the bat is powerful In physics terms we should really describe the bat in terms of its efficiency An efficient bat would be one that allows the batter to transfer the energy in his arms to the ball without in the process In fact all bats are very inefficient in the sense that only a small fraction of the energy in the arms is given to the ball Most of that energy is retained in the bat and in the arms as a result of the follow through after the bat strikes the ball Actors sometimes jump at the chance to play a huge response to some big news One character says to another You just won a million dollars And the actor immediately jumps up and down and yells about winning a million dollars But what would a person do Stanislavski a famous Russian theater director spoke of It often takes time for a person to process information whether it s very good or very bad Think back to a time in your life when some big news was delivered What did you do Did you immediately jump up and down scream with joy or pain Or did you just sit down for a moment saying nothing How long did it take to really understand that you won that award before you responded Be a person Don t just go for emotion or the obvious response There is no frame free way to evaluate anything Consider this example College students were asked whether they would support a multimillion dollar safety measure that would save lives at risk Is lives a lot or a little Well compared with what Other students were asked whether they would support a safety measure that would save percent of lives at risk These students were more favorable toward it than the students who were told it would save lives Obviously saving lives is better than saving percent of lives but a measure that saved percent of the lives seems clearly cost effective The percent figure provides the students with a frame that lives by itself does not Whether the money spent on safety is seen as a wise decision or not will depend on When people are told that a safety measure will save percent of lives a frame is created between lives and percent of lives In the early fifteenth century Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal sent his sailors to explore Africa and open it to Portuguese trade Portuguese expeditions began to work their way down the western coast always within sight of land Upon reaching Cape Bojador a rocky stretch of desolate coast with terrifying currents the Portuguese sailors would inevitably turn back convinced that this was the end of land and that no ship would ever pass it Prince Henry sent out expeditions between and until finally one succeeded by sailing a few kilometers out to sea and going south for a few kilometers thereby passing the dangerous rocks and currents As a navigation feat this change of direction was trivial While it is true that their ships were not strong and their navigation tools were primitive the major barrier was not technological but the fear of losing sight of land We can say that the feat of Christopher Columbus was far more difficult technically but he too faced a major barrier of fear both in his sponsors and in his crew Once the Atlantic was crossed this fear was swept away and only the reasonable fears of shipwreck disease and sea monsters remained Many barriers are of this type They are not merely unknown but unimaginable Major development can be achieved by having the courage to recognize and overcome barriers just as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors did Mike Michalowicz the author of The Pumpkin Plan argues that comedians are the ultimate public speakers For example comedians have to hold an audience s attention for an hour or more they don t get a break during their presentation and they can t rely on the audience for a Q A They are also expected to make the audience laugh constantly And they don t even get to use presentation software programs because they want the audience looking at them not trying to read a screen These facts don t mean you need to be a comedian on stage to perform well You aren t even required to tell jokes To enhance your own presentations however start to observe the techniques comedians use and employ them in your own speech Ironically it s usually when we try to do everything right that we wind up doing something wrong That s because the more balls you try to juggle the more likely you are to drop one You hope many extracurricular activities will get you into your first choice college so you spend hours working out with the football club run for student government and volunteer for hours on free afternoons Meanwhile you make time to try to keep your grades up With that kind of pressure you can misread an assignment double book your schedule or otherwise let people down but it s not your parents fault or your friends They aren t expecting too much of you by asking for one spot in your hectic schedule It s up to you to recognize your limits not sign up for too many extracurricular activities and admit when you ve dropped the ball Surfing is often thought of as a male sport but in fact women have been surfing in California since the early s and today there are women surfers in every surfing country in the world Like men they range from amateurs to professionals Though women may not have been taken seriously in surf contests these days they compete because they have truly earned that right One of the earliest women surfers was Mary Hawkins who showed very graceful form in the surf She was the first in a long line which stretched down in the s to Marge Calhoun and her daughters and Linda Benson followed by some of the top professional surfers today When the going gets tough tough people New research from Brigham Young University shows that dads are in a unique position to help their children develop persistence According to the study when children felt warmth and love from their father were told the reasons behind rules and were granted an appropriate level of autonomy they were able to set a foundation to flourish and cope with the stress and pressures of life Over time kids with fathers involved in their lives were more likely to become persistent which led to higher engagement in school and lower rates of delinquency After following families over several years two professors Laura Walker and Randal Day concluded that dads play a big role in helping their kids set goals and complete themOriginally a Dutch auction referred to a type of auction that starts with a high price that keeps going down until the item sells This is the opposite process from regular auctions where an item starts at a minimum price and bidders wrestle over it by increasing their offers In a Dutch auction however the auctioneer offers the item at a certain price and waits for somebody to agree If nobody does then he This continues until a participant says yes and thus wins the item There are no battles over items in a Dutch auction the first person to accept the offered price wins the item resulting in saving a lot of time Order effect is the prejudicial impact that the presentation order of a question idea answer or product has on a respondent Whether the item is located in the first last or middle position sometimes affects the selection of or response to that item There have been several studies that have noticed an order effect when an early stimulus acts as a frame of reference for later stimuli Robert Ferber from Illinois University had respondents rate a list of occupations and found that the maximum or minimum ratings occurred on the one presented first regardless of the ordering of the occupations In another study the subjects were asked to rate a beverage on intention to buy on a scale ranging from definitely would not buy to definitely would buy The first beverage tasted was rated significantly higher One of the greatest annoyances in today s gadget filled world is that we continuously manage to misplace them Finding a misplaced remote control smartphone or even our car keys is not only an annoyance but also a time consuming endeavor right A brilliant new invention called Stick N Find will change the way forgetful people live their lives Stick N Finds are about the size of a US quarter with each one containing a circuit board replaceable battery buzzer and LED light The tags can be stuck to items that are frequently lost such as car keys or the TV remote and a custom app allows the tags to be assigned to specific objects When the object is lost accessing the app on the smartphone will display how far away the object is up to feet Then the users can find the missing item by moving in different directions to identify its location The tag will also sound a buzzer or illuminate its LED lights aiding in the search For luggage pets and maybe your kids if you want to make sure they don t wander off too far from home this thing is absolutely perfect So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation In some instances of course there isn t time to slow down and we have to just react But generally we have more time than we allot ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions Slowing down provides time to consider how an issue has been framed and whether we have really considered all the relevant factors We ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider actions that could have serious consequences Putting on the mental brakes can stop you for example from reacting in anger to someone on the road a situation that can lead to danger If more of us would take just a couple extra moments to think an action through we would all be much better off I have always believed your home tells your story That tortoise shell on the wall There was one exactly like it in my mother s house and I can t see it without thinking about a thousand family dinners Those cuff links They belonged to somebody I loved we picked them out on one of the most perfect days we ever spent together Each object tells a story and each story connects us to one another and to the world The truth is things matter They have to They are what we live with and touch each and every day They represent what we have seen who we have loved and where we hope to go next They remind us of the good times and the rough patches and everything in between that has made us who we are According to the experts who are happiest in their careers most people encounter turning points at which they have a clear choice This choice is not as you might think Should I stay or should I go It is often a decision about doing something new on the job a training opportunity an offer to take on new responsibilities a chance to move into a new area with which one is unfamiliar There are a host of possibilities but the experts concur on this one point say yes As far as work is concerned those experts can point to a decision where they were tempted to say no where staying the course was more comfortable and less risky but they finally decided to give it a go Imagine that you are lying on a bed in a dental clinic If you were told only two times more versus only ten times more wouldn t you use different mental strategies to try to cope With either scenario you would pull out the comforting thought of only one more and then it s the last one at different times you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different point information lets us know what internal coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor A simple example you have some minor surgery You are told that on the first post surgical day there is going to be a lot of pain whereas by the second day you will just feel a bit achy Armed with that information you are more likely to plan on watching distracting videos on the first day and to devote day two to writing poems Dozens of studies have demonstrated the nature of self supervision For instance people who were asked to make tricky choices and trade offs such as setting up a wedding registry or ordering a new computer were worse at focusing and solving problems than others who had not made the tough choices In one study some people were asked to restrain their emotions while watching a sad movie about sick animals Afterward they exhibited less physical endurance than others who had let the tears flow freely The research shows that we burn up self control in a wide variety of situations managing the impression we are making on others coping with fears controlling our spending trying to focus on simple instructions such as Don t think of a white bear and many many others Our health is certainly a matter of how we feel but it is a lot more besides We must always factor in An individual may feel fine but if significant others in his or her community keep saying things like You don t seem like yourself or Is there something wrong that person may feel impelled to go to the doctor to get checked out The doctor in turn may perform various tests that indicate that there is indeed something wrong even if the person is as yet experiencing no overt symptoms Once the doctor has confirmed one s friends evaluation that something is wrong the person is very likely to start feeling a lot less lively Contentment is emotionally accepting your present as being what it is without being filled with resentment frustration or irritation at anything you are undergoing But that is thoroughly compatible with You aspire to be better or to accomplish more You are not satisfied to stay where you are existentially with no further growth and no further effects for good on your world You want to be and do more This is the dissatisfaction of aspiration It can be a very healthy goad to personal growth and fulfillment As Saint Augustine put it Be always displeased at what you are if you desire to attain to what you are not If you stand still in vertical rain you will only get wet on top of your head but once you start to move your front starts getting wet as well But crucially Think about it this way in every volume of space there is a certain density of raindrops Your front will meet that density of drops when you get to it no matter what your speed so going more slowly does not help It turns out that real world effects do give runners a small increase in dampness maybe the air currents caused by running suck in more rain than they repel or heavier footsteps cause more splashing but that is a drop in the bucket so to speak compared to the wetness you will prevent by getting to shelter quicker We naturally think in terms of cause and effect And this helps organize our experience of the world We think of ourselves as seeing some things cause other things to happen but in terms of our raw sense experience we just see certain things happen before other things and remember having seen such before and after sequences at earlier times For example a rock hits a window and then the window breaks We don t see a third thing called causation But we believe it has happened The rock hitting the window caused it to break But this is not experienced like the flight of the rock or the shattering of the glass Experience does not seem to force the concept of causation on us We just use it to interpret what we experience Cause and effect are categories that could never be read out of our experience and must therefore be to attribute such a connection In the case of a company it is common to describe culture as the visible elements of a working environment casual Fridays or free sodas in the cafeteria But as MIT s Edgar Schein explains those things don t define a culture They are just artifacts of it According to him culture is a way of working together toward common goals that people have followed so frequently and so successfully that they don t even think about trying to do things another way If a culture has formed people will autonomously do what they need to do to be successful Those instincts are not formed overnight Rather they are the result of shared learning In every organization there is that first time when a problem or challenge arises Those responsible reach a decision together on what to do and how to do it in order to succeed If that decision results in a successful outcome then the next time when those employees face a similar type of challenge they will return to the same decision and same way of solving the problem As long as the way they have chosen keeps working to solve the problem the culture will become an internal set of rules that people will draw upon in making the choices ahead of them They will just assume that the way they have been doing it is the way of doing it This causes an organization to become Managers don t need to enforce the rule People instinctively get on with what needs to be done  Annie what a great picture you ve made What is it What s wrong with this reaction to a child s drawing You re obviously interested and it sounds encouraging to your ears But this kind of praise can actually have the opposite effect Generalized praise like great picture isn t as meaningful to children as finding something specific about their performance or behavior I like the bright colors you used in your picture is more effective than great picture If you say That s nice dear without looking at what your child is trying to show you it could affect her self esteem Specific praise gives her confidence in your interest and lets her know you really care If you re too busy to do laundry don t worry about it At least your jeans will stay clean depending on your definition of clean After wearing a pair of unwashed jeans for fifteen months Josh Le a student at the University of Alberta handed them to Dr McQueen a textile scientist She sampled the bacteria living on the jeans Next Le washed the jeans He wore the jeans for only two weeks this time and Dr McQueen took a sample again The results Whether fifteen months or two weeks the bacteria growth was about the same Now what about the smell Le did air out his jeans three times a week and he reportedly still had lots of friends It wasn t until after a m that an airplane started to run down the runway toward the ocean for takeoff The airport was just a mile from the beautiful white sand beach The plane was only in the air for a few seconds before there was a loud bang Flames came out from one of the engines The people in the control tower heard the pilot say I m coming back around Then there were two more explosions The plane went off the radar screen in the control tower When the police arrived at the scene more than half of the plane had already sunk into the ocean Imagine you want to write a book You can usually type words in an hour working on your book This goes well for the first hours and you type words per hour However at the third hour you feel tired and you only type words That s words less than your usual output Output decreases over time when there are no breaks is important Taking time off recharges your batteries so you can sprint forward when you return to work Refresh and renew yourself your body mind and spirit Then get back to work Who would have thought years ago that a box made out of plastic and glass would ruin the manners of millions of people We know about the digital miracles brought by the smartphone But one of its biggest influences on our lives is the sudden breaking of standards of etiquette in less than a decade These days many smartphone owners check Twitter during a conversation and do not consider it impolite This usually takes place while someone else is talking a friend colleague or boss Younger smartphone users even have learned the art of texting one person while they themselves are talking to another Some scientists believe that certain animals use a type of language For example vervet monkeys have different sounds for different predators When an alarm call is given the monkeys know what predators eagles leopards or snakes are approaching However the monkeys aren t born knowing the meaning of each of these sounds Young monkeys learn the meaning of the sounds from listening to and watching older monkeys This learning takes some time After young monkeys learn the alarm call for seeing an eagle they use it whenever they see a large bird even if the bird is harmless Only after much trial and error do they realize that the eagle callWhen we design experiments we usually For example let s say a farmer wants to know what kind of plowing method is better The farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them He changes how he plows his fields Everything else will be the same on both fields the type of crop he grows the amount of water that he uses and the slope of the fields he plants on The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight If the farmer only changes how he plows his fields he can see the impact of the one change After the experiment is complete the farmer can conclude which plowing method is better In most cases sound reaches the ear through the air but air is not the only medium through which sound is carried When we make a loud noise it will frighten fish and cause them to swim away So we conclude that the sound must have reached them through the water An Indian puts his ear to the ground in order to detect distant footsteps Such sounds are comparatively clear when they are carried through the earth Similarly a gentle tapping at one end of a long table can be clearly heard at the opposite end if the ear is pressed against the table From these facts we can see thatPeople want their problems solved Questions like What s the problem and What are we going to do about this are important But whether they say it or not people often need some acknowledgment of feelings before they can move on to the conversation for problem solving Too often in difficult conversations we skip right to problem solving without acknowledging our partners feelings You re working too hard says your wife When was the last time we had dinner together You realize she s right and say Well for the next month my workload is a lot lighter I ll make an effort to be home every night by six o clock Your wife doesn t seem satisfied and you are left wondering what more you could have said But your wife s complaint is not a math problem You may think you ve solved the problem but her invisible questions haven t been answered Problem solving is important but it has to wait matters Your wife wants her feelings acknowledged first Saying It s been a tough time these last few months hasn t it or It sounds like you re feeling lonely would be more appropriate If children were required to excel only in certain areas they might be better able to cope with their parents expectations Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we make unfair genetic demands on our teens It is the only period in your life when you re expected to do all things well Adults don t hold themselves to those standards We don t interview the dentist about whether he can throw a basketball or quiz our accountant on biology before we let her do our taxes In elementary and high school we celebrate the generalist but in the real world there is no room for the generalist except on a quiz show We should not expect too much from our children We need to be careful when we use general terms to identify groups In some cases they make distinctions among the subgroups unclear For example people from both Guatemala and Mexico may be described as Latinos However their cultural backgrounds vary on several important dimensions so we should not view them as being from a homogeneous group Similarly the term Asian American blurs variations among people whose heritage is for example Chinese Korean or Japanese Whenever the subgroups have been identified we will use the more specific terms When we use the more general terms remember that they may not apply to all subgroups within the group described by the more general terms Sometimes we find a piece of writing hard to understand and we need to make the meaning clear which is possible through simulation A classic example is car insurance people They read the reports of accidents and have to figure out who is legally responsible for the accidents While nowadays they probably use computer simulation at one time they would use toy cars and drawings of the roads They would move the toy cars and note the damage that would occur according to the reports from the drivers making claims In this case the simulation makes the written material more understandable by presenting it in a visual way To study a text better you can use simulation with any convenient objects No one else can experience the way your heart feels about things No one can see through the lens you use to see life quite the same as you do Accept this Honor and praise it too Do not be quick to compromise it In your desire to fit in or make others happy you may be tempted to pretend to be someone you are not You may even pretend to believe things you don t really believe or act in ways that are out of character with who you really are When you do this you lose out on the real you The world loses out on you too Strive to be a healthy happy and enlightened person and then taking your place alongside your fellow travelers offer your self to the waiting world Many of the biggest stars in sports are tough to deal with and rarely does an agent develop a connection with them during the first encounter The most important lesson I learned as a sports agent is that it isn t just about signing a million dollar contract When I am working with a client there are hundreds of little things that take place during the weeks before we are ready to sit down and negotiate Small stuff plays a big part in how satisfied and comfortable my clients are with me and my services I often express interest in their recent vacation or how their children are doing in school Paying attention to is a huge sign of respect to today s top athletes One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory loss is the tendency to when things do not go well Here is a good example Jane a woman in her mid sixties recently got a call from her son who asked her to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor s visit A couple of days later the son called and asked Jane if she had gotten the bus pass She said with some guilt Oh no I m sorry I forgot all about that Her son s response was Well Mom I asked you to do that just two days ago Jane ended the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself she shouldn t have forgotten what her son had asked But her forgetfulness was not her fault She could not control the memory loss Cell phones seem to have achieved the status of of all the electronic consumer products The average person in America and Britain throws away his or her cell phone within eighteen months of purchase even though cell phones will last for ten years on average Every year more than million still working cell phones in the United States and million in Britain are retired Only a small fraction of them are reassembled for reuse or exported to foreign countries This trend isn t limited to both countries Many other advanced countries have also seen new types of cell phones replacing old ones almost annually Back in the th century trains weren t so easy to stop Engineers didn t just step on the brakes instead brakemen manually adjusted the speed with brake wheels on the roof of the cars Working on top of a moving train took concentration Cars rocked violently the wind roared past and brakemen had to jump from car to car at top speeds Often they were so intensely focused that they forgot to watch for upcoming tunnels or bridges You can imagine what happened when a brakeman didn t duck That s where telltales a series of ropes hung over the tracks came in Hung from about feet from tunnels and low hanging bridges the ropes would brush across the heads of brakemen to In Roy H William s book Free the Beagle he asks readers to imagine that their left brain is a lawyer and their right brain is the lawyer s pet beagle The beagle runs over and drops something at the feet of the lawyer The lawyer says I don t have time to play right now I m trying to concentrate But the beagle was bringing the lawyer a clue to help him with his work but the beagle cannot speak and explain his gift Unfortunately the lawyer doesn t realize the significance of the beagle s gift He thinks that his intellect is enough to solve the problem and ignores the beagle s assistance The left brain thinks like the lawyer The left brain has an ego Don t ever let anyone convince you that though because if that is true half of your brain exists for no reason at all What a delicious feeling it must be to get up in the morning with nothing to do To most of us it is a treat that comes very few times after childhood just a day or two in the year There is no need to go off on a long tour to climb mountains and to sail on rivers We are able to sleep as long as we like in the morning to dress as leisurely as we please and then to go down quietly through the day having absolutely nothing to do but to please ourselves It is the very extreme of pleasure to lie down beneath an old oak tree upon a breezy hill and hear the wind rustling among the leaves Moreover the idle days are not We have time to think of other people when the general strain is relaxed We grow pitiful towards our hard worked brothers and sisters and think how happy it would make us to see them all with nothing to do for a few days Of course many of them would soon get tired of it but surely it would be helpful to make them feel glad to start their work again about which they have complained three hundred days of every year Let as many of us as possible take this great pleasure of nothing to do for a day or two at least We shall go back to our work happily after it One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the wrong time to start whatever our project is and we should wait until the time is right Tim Ferriss author of the bestselling book The H our Workweek has this to say about timing For all the most important things the timing is always wrong Waiting for a good time to quit your job The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time Conditions are never perfect Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you If it s important to you and you want to do it eventually just do it and correct course along the way If you wait for the timing to be right before you make a move you may never make a move at all The biggest game changer in our future is life prolongation It works for mice and worms and surely it will work for the rest of us some day Biologists are now tinkering with so called anti aging substances trying to get you the benefit of life prolongation But life gets its edge from the possibility of its ending What will life be like when we live forever No one dies No one gets older No more evolution No need to hurry If you want something done give it to a busy man but nobody needs to be busy when you have forever Who is going to do the real work then Chosen people who will volunteer or be volunteered to be mortal Life without death changes absolutely everything If we want things to stay as they are then things will have to change  In Western culture playing the masculine role has traditionally required traits such as independence assertiveness and dominance Females are expected to be more nurturing and sensitive to other people Are these masculine and feminine roles universal Could biological differences between the sexes lead inevitably to gender differences in behavior In anthropologist Margaret Mead compared the gender roles adopted by people in three tribal societies on the island of New Guinea and her observations are certainly thought provoking In the Arapesh tribe both men and women were taught to play what we would regard as a feminine role They were cooperative non aggressive and sensitive to the needs of others Both men and women of the Mundugumor tribe were brought up to be aggressive and emotionally unresponsive to other people a masculine pattern of behavior by Western standards Finally the Tchambuli tribe displayed a pattern of gender role development that was the direct opposite of the Western pattern Males were passive emotionally dependent and socially sensitive whereas females were dominant independent and assertive  The relationship between physical products and individual ownership is undergoing a profound evolution We don t want the CD we want the music it plays We don t want the disc we want the storage it holds We don t want the answering machine we want the messages it saves We don t want the DVD we want the movie it carries In other words we want not the stuff but the needs or experiences it fulfills As our possessions dematerialize into the intangible our preconceptions of ownership are changing creating a dotted line between what s mine what s yours and what s ours This shift is fueling a world where has more value than possession and as Kevin Kelly a founder of Wired magazine puts it where access is better than ownership  Scientists and educators have long sought to understand the emergence of expertise artistic and otherwise Many researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can simply come down to Studies of eminent scientists in the s supported this view by underscoring the individuals capacity for endurance concentration and commitment to effortful practice Benjamin Bloom an education psychologist wrote in that none of his subjects achieved expertise without a supportive environment and a long and intensive period of training This education came first from encouraging instructors and later from demanding master teachers A few years later psychologist K Anders Ericsson of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in piano violin chess or athletics The investigations revealed that a person s level of achievement correlated strongly with the amount of practice put in  In the command and control management model plans were considered destiny Top management formulated exacting plans for every aspect of operations and then kept everything under tight control to meet the plan All too often however plans were derailed by unanticipated events Planning is no longer the exclusive domain of top management it now typically involves those who carry out the plans because they are closer to the customer Planning experts who recommend strategic agility say managers need to to take advantage of opportunities A good analogy of this would be an improvisational comedy act The stand up comic has a plan for the introduction structure of the act some tried and true jokes and closing remarks Within this planned framework the comic will play off the audience s input and improvise as necessary Let s think about flipping a coin If you get ten heads in a row what is the likelihood that the next flip will be heads Don t be fooled it s percent the same as it is on any single coin flip Most people think the chances of getting heads will actually be lower than percent the opposite of momentum They know they should see roughly the same number of heads as tails so they feel that if they have seen ten heads in a row they are due for a tails A tails has to emerge But it doesn t There is no law of averages If the process is random there is no predictability This is also what drives the gambler s fallacy Gamblers on losing streaks erroneously believe they are due for a win and keep gambling thinking that their luck But if the whole thing is random you aren t due for anything Your chances haven t changed at all If you have ever had a sip of the bitters you would probably frown just thinking about it According to a study from researchers at Brooklyn College the horrible taste does more than that Researchers had fifty seven students rate their moral distaste for several morally dubious acts such as politicians taking bribes students cheating on tests and the like Before they started rating the acts the students drank shots of one of three drinks bitter tasting liquid sweet beverage or water On a point scale with being the worst rating for a morally reprehensible act the students who drank the bitter liquid gave the acts an average rating of those who drank the sweet beverage gave an average of and the water group gave an average of The ratings of the sweet beverage and water groups were statistically the same but the bitter liquid group rating was significantly higher This study suggests that the bad taste When a certain word which is to be defined crops up in its own definition we call it a circular definition The point of defining a term is to explain its meaning this obviously cannot be achieved if you need already to understand the meaning of the term in order to understand the definition For example to define stress as the physiological and psychological responses to stressful situations would be to give a circular definition This is because stressful situations are presumably only recognizable from the fact that they tend to produce stress but the meaning of stress is the very thing which someone requesting the definition is seeking to understand and so should not be presupposed in the definition To define philosophy as the activity carried out by philosophers would be another example of a circular definition  For years Switzerland had been trying to find a place to store radioactive nuclear waste One location designated as a potential nuclear waste site was the small village of Wolfenschiessen In some economists surveyed the residents of the village asking whether they would vote to accept a nuclear waste repository if the Swiss parliament decided to build it there Although the facility was widely viewed as an undesirable addition to the neighborhood a slim majority percent of residents said they would accept it Apparently their sense of civic duty outweighed their concern about the risks Then the economists added a sweetener suppose parliament offered to compensate each resident with an annual monetary payment Then would you favor it The result support went down not up Adding the financial incentive cut the rate of acceptance in half from to percent Even when the economists increased the monetary offer the result was unchanged Why would more people accept nuclear waste for free than for pay Standard economic analysis suggests that offering people money to accept a burden would increase not decrease their willingness to do so But the economists who led the study point out that the price effect is sometimes invalidated by For villagers willingness to accept the nuclear waste site reflected public spirit a recognition that the country as a whole depended on nuclear energy and that the nuclear waste had to be stored somewhere Against the background of this civic commitment the offer of cash to residents of the village felt like a bribe an effort to buy their vote Last Memorial Day I was invited to my cousin s house for a barbecue The last thing I wanted to do was spend hours in traffic So I decided to take a different route I traveled the back roads instead of the highway My family and I enjoyed the scenery and there was hardly any traffic A simple change in route changed our whole day When we do the same old thing the same old way for too long we become bored and boredom fosters bad attitudes Try something new at least once a day It doesn t have to be anything major Even a small disruption in the routine can create a fresh approach and a new way of looking at things  Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long Your frog is your biggest most important task It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment If you have many important tasks before you start with the biggest hardest and most important task first Discipline yourself to begin immediately and then persist until the task is complete before you go on to something else Are you a forgetful student Do you often experience headaches Then perhaps you just need to increase your water intake to revive your brain function It is known that of our brain tissue is water Hence water is a vital component for the smooth function of our brain And according to research if a person s body is short of water his brain releases a hormone called cortisol that has a shrinkage effect to the brain which then decreases its memory power Inadequate water in the brain is also the culprit of being forgetful restless and slow Headaches are also more frequent when our brain lacks water So never ever let yourself get thirsty because you are making your brain shrink become restless and forgetful  The founding population of our direct ancestors is not thought to have been much larger than individuals some think the group was as small as a few hundred How then did we go from such a fragile minority population to a tide of humanity billion strong and growing There is only one way according to Richard Potts You give up on You don t try to beat back the changes You begin not to care about consistency within a given habitat because such consistency isn t an option You adapt to variation itself It was a brilliant strategy Instead of learning how to survive in just one or two ecological environments we took on the entire globe The major change in mapping in the past decade as opposed to in the previous to years is that mapping has become It s not the map itself that has changed You would recognize a map and the latest modern map as having almost the same look But the old map was a fixed piece of paper the same for everybody who looked at it The new map is different for everyone who uses it You can drag it where you want to go you can zoom in as you wish you can switch modes traffic satellite you can fly across your town even ask questions about restaurants and directions So a map has gone from a fixed stylized portrait of the Earth to a dynamic interactive conversation about your use of the Earth As parents of multiple children know there is no one simple formula for meeting a baby s needs From birth each baby has a unique personality and preferences Each baby s nervous system is unique as well Some babies might be calmed by noise and activity whereas others might prefer quiet The key is to learn what your baby needs and respond to them accordingly Even though all of the sounds and cries may sound the same at first your baby is communicating with you in different ways using sound and movement An arched back eyes tightly closed fists curled up rubbing eyes all of these signs communicate something specific about your baby s emotional and physical state Your task is to become a n and find out what your baby is communicating and how best to respond Jupiter is here In the early hours of September an astronomer in Oregon spotted a bright flash of light on Jupiter Astronomers believe this brilliant burst to be an asteroid hitting the giant planet Scientists say that the asteroid may have been heading for Earth but instead Jupiter took the blow And this may not be the first time Jupiter has saved Earth from being hit Jupiter has the strongest gravitational pull of any planet The gravitational pull of Jupiter grabs passing asteroids and pulls them to its surface and away from Earth The impacts are leading scientists to study possible marks from asteroids on Jupiter Chances of actually hitting Earth are very unlikely but scientists keep a close watch on asteroids as there are so many of them in orbit Psychologists distinguish between two types of stress good stress called eustress and bad stress called distress Many people would probably be surprised that stress can benefit you and your body but that is exactly what eustress does This is not only good for you it is actually designed When humans encounter a dangerous circumstance their breathing becomes faster their heart rate increases and their throat and nose muscles open up to allow more air to get to the lungs This physical reaction prepares the body either to fight the danger or to escape it For example if you were alone on the street and encountered a stranger late at night your body might prepare your heart and lungs to help you run away as quickly as possible from the danger Without eustress you would never get this head start Teachers at Stone Mountain State College S M S C give higher grades than teachers at other colleges in the state college system More than one third of the undergraduate grades awarded in the spring semester were A s and only percent were F s The percentage of A s awarded to graduate students was even higher almost two thirds were A s The students of course may be happy because they received high grades However evidence suggests that this trend is When they applied to a graduate or professional school they got disadvantages because the admission offices believed an A from S M S C is not equal to an A from other universities Grade inflation therefore may hurt a student from S M S C who intends to apply to a graduate or professional school  Leaders and managers used to be told to keep a stiff upper lip and not show emotion to remove emotion from the situation at hand and just deal with the facts Despite all your efforts to mask emotions they will come out in some form and people have an innate ability to pick up on this Emotions are always at play so we need to reframe the role that emotions play in the workplace We need to view emotions as the fuel that drives the engine of productivity and innovation The reality is that you will never separate emotions from your workplace Individuals who are good at dealing with the tough stuff are those who have learned and even mastered the art of managing emotions So instead of spending time in trying to push aside or suppress emotions it is far better to learn how to manage them well In numerous experiments conducted mostly at Brandeis University psychologist Theresa Amabile sought the conditions that might influence creativity In a typical experiment she would ask the participants to produce some creative product Depending on the experiment the product might be a poem or a short story In the experiment Amabile would tell some of the participants that their products were going to be evaluated for creativity by a panel of experts Other participants were told nothing about evaluation or about any consequences The results of these experiments were quite consistent The participants who made the most creative products were those who did not know that their products would be evaluated They were the ones just playing not concerned about judgments  A few years ago I received a surprise birthday present from a friend a tandem skydive Falling through the sky fifteen thousand feet from the ground was never on my wish list All the same that was exactly what I was about to do My friend initially intended for the skydive to be a surprise However my friend decided it might be wise to let me get used to the idea of jumping from a plane in advance so that I could prepare emotionally Entering the words skydiving and perish on Google revealed that approximately thirty people die every year in the United States while skydiving This may seem a large number at first however considering the million jumps every year it is in fact a small percentage Although I had experienced three days of stressful anticipation having that time allowed me to acquire knowledge regarding the threatening event My fear was reduced by the information I had gathered allowing me to enjoy the experience more  A new study suggests that influence our experience of the food People perceived yogurt as denser and more expensive when eaten with lighter spoons the researchers report today in the journal Flavour probably because those spoons matched their expectations But yogurt tasted with that spoon was also rated as less sweet than when eaten with heavier or larger spoons And the people thought yogurt tasted sweeter when they ate it with a white spoon than with a black one In a final experiment with different types of cheese the researchers found that people rated cheese as saltier when they sampled it with a knife insead of a fork spoon or toothpick This may have been because eating with a knife is an unusual behavior the researchers speculated or because it reminded people of using a knife to try samples in a cheese shop where cheeses tend to be more aged and therefore saltier People make purchasing decisions by choosing between alternatives or by rejecting certain options But a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research finds that focusing on rejecting an option can lead consumers to their preferences Why does this happen When consumers reject options they need to decide which alternative they do not want so they focus on options that are less preferred in order to assess if they should reject those options This shift of focus makes them more likely to notice appealing features of the initially less preferred option For example a newly married couple who prefers an apartment closer to the subway station because of easy access to it but doesn t have enough money was told to select an apartment to reject an apartment closer to the subway station or a less expensive one farther from the station Simply instructing them to decide which one they would like to reject makes them more likely to choose the less expensive apartment as their place to live in Similarly those who said they would prefer a less expensive apartment selected the apartment close to the station With old friends you can argue about politics tell informal jokes and reveal sensitive personal facts With new coworkers though you probably avoid discussions of politics tell only the cleanest jokes and avoid lots of highly personal topics Over time you may overhear jokes told by colleagues and get a sense of what type of humor is appropriate in your workplace Chances are though that when you tell jokes of your own to the group you will keep your topics well within the borders defined by the jokes you have heard told by your colleagues That is the first jokes you hear told by your colleagues help When you tell a joke of your own you are testing that belief The safest way to test that belief is to stick within the range of what you already believe to be acceptable Have you ever noticed that you sometimes lean forward when someone you re talking with leans forward The Chameleon Effect is the unintentional physical and verbal mirroring between people who are getting along well People may mimic each others body posture hand gestures speaking accents and other behaviors when they are in rapport The body is actually autonomously making the interaction smoother and increasing the level of liking while communicating The experiment conducted by Tanya Chartrand and her colleague showed that mimicry facilitated the smoothness of interactions and increased liking between interaction partners Experimenters saw an increase in a subject s behavior such as shaking their foot when they shook their foot during an interaction When experimenters intentionally copied the mannerisms of a subject the subject reported Empathic individuals those who took the perspective of others were also found to mirror another person s action more often Before a person can overcome self esteem problems and build healthy self esteem it helps to know what might cause them Obviously self esteem can be hurt when someone whose acceptance is important like a parent or teacher constantly puts you down But criticism doesn t have to come from other people Self esteem can also Some teens have an inner critic a voice inside that seems to find fault with everything they do And people sometimes unintentionally model their inner voice after a critical parent or someone else whose opinion is important to them Over time listening to a negative inner voice can harm a person s self esteem just as much as if the criticism were coming from another person Some people get so used to their inner critic being there that they don t even notice when they re putting themselves down There is an interesting phenomenon where people are perceived as possessing a trait that they describe in others Telling others that your math professor is lazy will cause them to infer that you are lazy This works the other way too describing positive attributes about your friend may ascribe you those attributes as well Several experiments showed that people will associate personality traits to communicators mindlessly without logical rationale They also have a poor recollection of whether the communicator was describing themselves or someone else in a conversation So be careful when gossiping about a co worker or you might be seen as what you describe And if you want to appear more charming perhaps you could add that word to your vocabulary when talking about others Furthermore maybe it would be a good idea to keep your negative thoughts to yourself As the old saying goes We tell friends about our new clothing purchases and show family members what we re sending to the local newspaper This desire to share our thoughts opinions and experiences is one reason social media and online social networks have become so popular People blog about their preferences post Facebook status updates about what they ate for lunch and tweet about why they hate the current government As many observers have commented today s social network addicted people cannot seem to stop sharing what they think like and want with everyone all the time Indeed research finds that more than percent of what people talk about is their personal experiences or personal relationships Similarly around half of tweets are me focused covering what people are doing now or something that has happened to them Why do people talk so much about their own attitudes and experiences It s more than just vanity we re actually wired to find it pleasurable Harvard neuroscientists Jason Mitchell and Diana Tamir found that information about the self is intrinsically rewarding In one study Mitchell and Tamir hooked subjects up to brain scanners and asked them to share either their own opinions and attitudes I like snowboarding or the opinions and attitudes of another person He likes puppies They found that sharing personal opinions activated the same brain circuits that respond to rewards like food and money So talking about what you did this weekend might feel just as good as taking a delicious bite of double chocolate cake Common wisdom states If it tastes good it s not good for you It also says If you get to eat the foods you like you re not dieting There is no evidence to support these claims In fact many diets fail due to this attitude When dieting there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna water and protein powder in a blender for lunch His idea was that food didn t need to taste good what really mattered was getting nutrients That mentality may work for some But if you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull or that they can t ever eat what they like you are setting them up for failure Flavor in the diet helps to ensure success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your calorie budget The psychological advice warns us most often about the limits of argumentation in dealing with another person and the truth at the same time As Sir Thomas Browne once warned in all disputes the more passion there is the less purpose there is Debate you often hear typically generates more heat than light Passion clouds reason And in the context of an interpersonal argument or debate people sometimes are willing to do anything to save face Joseph Addison once observed Our rivals in debates put me in the mind of the cuttlefish that when he is unable to protect himself blackens the water about him till he becomes invisible So as Publilius Syrus concluded long ago in a heated argument we are apt to lose sight of the truth There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for our dilemma about how to live history I believe that the future of the art of living can be found by gazing into the past If we explore how people have lived in other epochs and cultures we can draw out lessons for the challenges and opportunities of everyday life What secrets for living with passion lie in medieval attitudes towards death or in the pin factories of the industrial revolution How might an encounter with Ming dynasty China or Central African indigenous culture change our views about bringing up our kids and caring for our parents It is astonishing that until now we have made so little effort to unveil this wisdom from the past which is based on how people have actually lived rather than utopian dreamings of what might be possible The person who relates to certain individuals as family members or friends to the exclusion of others does not affirm that those to whom he relates are better persons He affirms only that they are his relatives or friends When a new father tells his two week old daughter that she is the cutest little girl in town he is not informing the infant that she would win a beauty contest of girls of her age before a fair panel of judges He is more than anything else telling her that she is his little girl The same is true in general when people assert that their spouses their parents and their sons and daughters are the best The highest praises are used to indicate that certain persons Some social critics would argue that the move toward an increasingly isolated individualism had been underway for some time at least since the middle of the twentieth century when psychoanalysis had infused the ideal of individual self making with a new psychological component Emotional well being the subjective experience of happiness and the pursuit of pleasure rather than say the accumulation of wealth community involvement and moral virtue began to be equated with success This focus on self fulfillment constituted a departure from the traditional criteria for evaluating success While the self made man of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries aimed to achieve success in terms that were largely external and measurable for example accumulation of wealth status or power late twentieth century self making involves the pursuit of the rather more elusive and variable state of self fulfillment With the emergence of an emphasis on self fulfillment one finds there is no end point for self making individuals canUntil J K Rowling s Harry Potter series set in motion an extraordinary child to adult crossover craze that took the entire world by storm books generally crossed over in the opposite direction Children In fact this type of readership transgression has been going on almost as long as books have existed Many of the world s great classics were appropriated very early on by children even though they were not written with young readers in mind Some works very quickly assumed the status of crossover works A number of them became almost the sole property of children a prime example being Daniel Defoe s Robinson Crusoe which is read by children around the world but very rarely by adults in any country First published in Defoe s most celebrated work was not meant for children but became a classic of children s literature and inspired countless adaptations and edited versions Horseshoe crabs have copper in their blood that makes the blood turn royal blue in the air The odd colored blood has an amazing trait It detects bacteria germs and forms a clot In the s scientists invented a test using horseshoe blood to detect endotoxins the chemical poisons some bacteria make in human medicines Just a tiny amount of endotoxins in a person s bloodstream can cause dangerous fevers and even death To test if a drug is clean of bacteria or endotoxins the drug is mixed with an extract from horseshoe blood called Limulus lysate If a jellylike clot forms the drug is not safe The Limulus lysate test is quick and can detect even the tiniest amount of endotoxins It is used worldwide to check if medicines blood donations and medical supplies are clean and safe Every year the extraordinary blue bloods No animal surpasses humans in and we ve been doing it for a long time The Iceman whose year old corpse was discovered on a glacier on the Italian Austrian border had stuffed grasses into his shoes to keep his feet warm and was carrying a sloe berry Human transport of plants increased abundantly as our transportation technology developed People transported and introduced some non native species intentionally for food fiber medicine ornament or scientific curiosity Seeds of other plants were introduced accidentally in sacks of seed grain wool or cotton or in mud stuck to machinery Human activities like farming irrigation forestry and mining have made it easier for these non native species to become established by removing native vegetation disturbing the soil and altering the availability of water and nutrients Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of nomadic culture It emerged in the nineteenth century in response to a variety of social forces First the Romantic movement encouraged communing with the beauties of nature while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider who rebelled against organized society According to the historians of camping Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy works like Friedrich Schiller s The Robbers and George Borrow s nineteenth century gypsy tales the gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple heroic life under the stars contemptuous of settled town dwellers in their dull comfort A second influence was the age of empire European powers in Africa and Asia were busy trekking into the dark wilderness pitching their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands Camping was necessary for colonial expansion and became a way of life not only for the troops but for the explorers and missionaries A final factor was the rise of emigration Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia the United States Canada and South Africa working as trappers lumberjacks and ranchers or lured by the gold rushes A specialist industry grew up to supply their needs tents camp beds stoves kettles camp matches and coffee Their tales of rough adventure were soon popularized in the press back home Camping was becoming part of the cultural imagination  While most experts say eight hours of sleep is ideal the truth is it all depends on how you feel Some people do well with seven hours or less while others require nine or more to be at their best If you are ill or under tremendous stress you will probably need to sleep longer than you usually do The best indicator of how much sleep you need should be based on how you feel Keep in mind that sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking that we re getting enough sleep If you are getting sufficient sleep you should feel refreshed and not have trouble getting out of bed in the morning What Hippocratic ideas are still in practice today Even though Hippocrates lived nearly years ago many of his ideas sound very familiar today He would inquire about the family health history to see if any relatives had suffered from similar diseases He asked questions about the patient s home to see if his or her environment might be causing the illness He discovered that diet played an important role in preventing disease Hippocrates was the first to understand the physical illness caused by emotional stress He even made suggestions on what we call bedside manner He said physicians should pay as much attention to the comfort and welfare of the patient as to the disease itself One of the ways to identify your values is to look at what frustrates or upsets you Anger often indicates an ignored value or a misdirected passion Think of specific times when you were mad or frustrated What about these situations upset you most Write down your descriptions of them To find your values reflect on the words or phrases you ve written to focus on what s most important to you For example if you get annoyed when someone asks you about something he could figure out for himself perhaps you value resourcefulness independence or taking care of oneself Consider how running yoga and weight lifting Running improves aerobic capacity which in turn will enhance your endurance when weight lifting or through a long yoga class The increased flexibility from yoga will lengthen your running stride allowing you to run smoother and faster Your improved flexibility will also increase your range of motion while weight lifting which in turn will make your muscles stronger Lifting weights increases muscle strength which will make you a stronger runner and improve your endurance and balance when maintaining difficult yoga postures All of these activities reinforce one another and the total benefit is much greater than the sum of its parts People may or may not remember what you said or did but they will always remember Have you ever noticed when people enter a room they bring a type of energy with them For example you re at your office talking with someone when another person approaches you and you get a feeling of Oh great I m so glad he s coming Or maybe it s a feeling of Oh man he s coming over here Let me get out of here before he comes because he s either going to say something I don t like or try to make me feel inferior What energy do you carry when you enter a room Are you a person who brightens up the room Or are you bringing in storm clouds People are loyal to their e mail There appears to be an unwritten expectation that you are accessible and available so if someone sends you something you will read it understand it and respond immediately That s the deal And when you break the deal you are not a team player you are not competent and something is wrong with you Every day and sometimes constantly throughout the day you have to check your e mail Why You may have received an e mail that if left unopened will have an impact on how you are perceived E mail has become a n It says Read me feed me do what I say It demands our attention directs our work and has a controlling presence in our lives Ethical decision making requires us to look beyond the immediate moment and beyond personal needs and desires to imagine the possible consequences of our choices and behavior on self and others In its most elemental sense moral imagination is about in our interactions with others In some sense moral imagination is a dramatic virtual rehearsal that allows us to examine different courses of action to determine the morally best thing to do The capacity for empathy is crucial to moral imagination As we have no immediate experience of what others feel we can have no idea of how they are affected Only by conceiving what we ourselves would feel in the situation can we understand how they feel Humans who lived as hunter gatherers more than years ago fitted into ecosystems by acting as predators and on occasion they probably also served as prey The role of humans in today s ecosystems differs from that of early human settlements Today humans in almost every part of the world People have detached themselves from most ecosystems Modern humans also tend to negatively affect ecosystems in ways that the earliest civilizations did not One aspect of the study of ecosystems in environmental science provides a clue as to how disconnected humans have become from nature Many ecosystems are named for the dominant species within them Therefore the world contains coral reef ecosystems evergreen forest ecosystems grassland ecosystems and so on but environmental science contains no human ecosystems Let s think about waiting in line Whether you re at a bank supermarket or amusement park waiting in line is probably not your idea of fun Consider the almost universal motivation to get through the line as quickly as possible Under what circumstances would you be willing to let another person cut in front of you in the line Small changes in the way that requests are made can often lead to some startlingly big results But is it possible that just a single word from a requester could drastically increase the likelihood that you d say Yes go ahead Yes and the single word is because Behavioral scientist Ellen Langer and her colleagues decided to put the of this word to the test In one study Langer arranged for a stranger to approach someone waiting in line to use a photocopier and simply ask Excuse me I have five pages May I use the copy machine Faced with this direct request to cut ahead in the line percent of the people were willing to agree to allow the stranger to go ahead of them However when the stranger made the request with a reason May I use the copy machine because I m in a rush percent of the people said yes After all providing a solid reason for the request justifies asking to jump ahead When was the last time you dreamed I m not talking about what went down last night while you were sleeping I m talking about really letting your mind think over something major you want to make happen in your life Can t remember Don t have time for such follies You need to change that starting today Sounds obvious but the first step toward making a dream come true is to actually have a dream At some point in your life you probably wanted something with your whole heart and it didn t happen And that hurt You might have stopped dreaming Maybe you didn t do it consciously but you began to avoid letting yourself go after scary goals It s a universal occurrence it happens to almost everyone But you can overcome this common limitation and start dreaming again Many predators direct their initial attack at the head of their prey Some prey species have taken advantage of this tendency by evolving false heads located at their posterior end Individuals of the species Thecla togarna for example possess a false head with dummy antennae at the tips of their hindwings Upon landing the butterfly moves its hindwings and thereby the dummy antennae up and down while keeping the true antennae motionless Thecla togarna s second trick occurs at the instant of landing when the butterfly quickly turns so that its false head points in the direction of previous flight An approaching predator is thus confronted with a prey that flutters off in the direction opposite to that expected Experimental tests have demonstrated that markings associated with false heads misdirect the attacks of avian predators and increase the possibility of escape of the prey There is no way that we two legged creatures can keep up with many four legged animals in a head to head sprint but in recent years some anthropologists have suggested that the human species has evolved in such a way as to be built for marathon running Researchers from Harvard University and the University of Utah point to our long legs and short arms as being suited to running necessary for our early hunter gatherer lifestyle on the African savannah More specifically the scientists highlight the abundance of tendons in our legs used little in walking but essential for running our large leg joints for shock absorption and our relative lack of body hair for minimizing rises in body temperatures These characteristics demonstrate that the human body as a whole is comparatively well suited to endurance running compared to other animals It is not a new idea that cooking is an activity that humans In the Scottish writer James Boswell noting that no beast is a cook called Homo sapiens the cooking animal Fifty years later in The Physiology of Taste the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin claimed that cooking made us who we are by teaching men to use fire it had done the most to advance the cause of civilization More recently L vi Strauss writing in The Raw and the Cooked in reported that many of the world s cultures entertained a similar view regarding cooking as the symbolic activity that establishes the difference between animals and people When we begin each book we roll up our sleeves and do everything we can to ease students into academic reading This means that we frame the text before students read it We provide a specific purpose for reading each chapter We design close readings that enable kids to explore more deeply than surface level reading We model to students how we would read the text About halfway through the novel we should begin to step out of the process and begin requiring our students to take the journey on their own Teachers should not hold the hands of their students all the way through the novel If the front half of the book is taught properly students should be equipped to read the second half of the book with much less assistance from the instructor Students should be encouraged to Consider the power of a baseball bat All the energy gained by the bat is supplied by the batter The bat is just an instrument that helps send the ball on its way If it does its job well then we usually say that the bat is powerful In physics terms we should really describe the bat in terms of its efficiency An efficient bat would be one that allows the batter to transfer the energy in his arms to the ball without in the process In fact all bats are very inefficient in the sense that only a small fraction of the energy in the arms is given to the ball Most of that energy is retained in the bat and in the arms as a result of the follow through after the bat strikes the ball Actors sometimes jump at the chance to play a huge response to some big news One character says to another You just won a million dollars And the actor immediately jumps up and down and yells about winning a million dollars But what would a person do Stanislavski a famous Russian theater director spoke of It often takes time for a person to process information whether it s very good or very bad Think back to a time in your life when some big news was delivered What did you do Did you immediately jump up and down scream with joy or pain Or did you just sit down for a moment saying nothing How long did it take to really understand that you won that award before you responded Be a person Don t just go for emotion or the obvious response There is no frame free way to evaluate anything Consider this example College students were asked whether they would support a multimillion dollar safety measure that would save lives at risk Is lives a lot or a little Well compared with what Other students were asked whether they would support a safety measure that would save percent of lives at risk These students were more favorable toward it than the students who were told it would save lives Obviously saving lives is better than saving percent of lives but a measure that saved percent of the lives seems clearly cost effective The percent figure provides the students with a frame that lives by itself does not Whether the money spent on safety is seen as a wise decision or not will depend on When people are told that a safety measure will save percent of lives a frame is created between lives and percent of lives In the early fifteenth century Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal sent his sailors to explore Africa and open it to Portuguese trade Portuguese expeditions began to work their way down the western coast always within sight of land Upon reaching Cape Bojador a rocky stretch of desolate coast with terrifying currents the Portuguese sailors would inevitably turn back convinced that this was the end of land and that no ship would ever pass it Prince Henry sent out expeditions between and until finally one succeeded by sailing a few kilometers out to sea and going south for a few kilometers thereby passing the dangerous rocks and currents As a navigation feat this change of direction was trivial While it is true that their ships were not strong and their navigation tools were primitive the major barrier was not technological but the fear of losing sight of land We can say that the feat of Christopher Columbus was far more difficult technically but he too faced a major barrier of fear both in his sponsors and in his crew Once the Atlantic was crossed this fear was swept away and only the reasonable fears of shipwreck disease and sea monsters remained Many barriers are of this type They are not merely unknown but unimaginable Major development can be achieved by having the courage to recognize and overcome barriers just as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors did "
