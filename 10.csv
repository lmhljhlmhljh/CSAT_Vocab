Museums should strive to block the path of pest infestation.,"Pests are a concern for collection preservation and a health risk, and both issues must be addressed by a facilities
management plan. Pest management starts with good housekeeping, so the museum’s overall custodial staff must be
considered part of the pest management team. A program should be established that looks for likely invasion routes of
pests into a museum facility and takes steps to prevent use of these routes. Efforts should be made to prevent pests from
entering the museum building at points such as visitor entrances, service entrances, air intake points, food facilities,
windows, and cracks and breaks in the building. Housekeeping should be concentrated at these points of entry.",201610,opinion,CSAT,UNK

Pets increase the friendly social identity accompanying people,"In England, Dr. Peter Messent followed people on their walks through city parks and found that people with dogs were
much more likely to be engaged in conversation than people who were walking alone. People with pets were even more
approachable than mothers with small infants. The same kind of results were observed in another study, by Randall
Lockwood. He showed subjects a series of relatively ambiguous pictures of people in a variety of common social settings.
There were two similar sets of pictures: in one there were only people, and in the other there was a pet with one of the
people in each scene. The subjects were asked to rate each of the people in the pictures according to several scales. The
results were predictable. People with pets were perceived as being more socially attractive and as having more desirable
personal characteristics. Pets changed the people’s social identity for the better.",201610,topic,CSAT,UNK
positive effects of immigration on the host country,"Not just information but also people may move between societies, taking their knowledge and cultural practices with
them. Like war, migration is an ancient phenomenon and very common throughout history. Although it is often regarded
with suspicion, immigration tends to confer benefits on the host group. In recent history, countries with the highest net
inward migration have also had the highest growth rates, the two factors clearly being linked in harmony. The complaint
that immigrants take people’s jobs is, like similar complaints about technology, based on an erroneously static view of the
world. In fact, immigrants increase the size of the market and thus create jobs. Furthermore, they arrive as already
productive adults having never been dependent on the host country. They also tend to be motivated and intelligent
individuals with a talent for the creation of economic organization.",201610,topic,CSAT,UNK

"We tend to not only base new inventions on old, but also explain and try to understand new inventions

The use of metaphor and the process of design and the evolution of science and technology are cyclic in the sense that
metaphors help to shape technology, and new technology leads to new metaphors. Major changes arise periodically, such
as moving from horsedrawn carriages to motordriven vehicles. The initial description of the latter is naturally metaphorical, as in the term “horseless carriage.” The association with the previous technology is both verbal and visual.
The early designs of such vehicles show visual evidence of the metaphor, as they retained much of the appearance of
horsedrawn carriages. The horsedrawn carriage was itself a technological innovation, as were the horseless carriage and
later automobiles. ",201610,blank,CSAT,UNK
"As environmentalist Rupert Cutler once noted, “Asphalt is the land’s last crop"".","As the new century begins, the competition between cars and crops for cropland is intensifying. Until now, the paving
over of cropland has occurred largely in industrial countries, home to four fifths of the world’s 520 million automobiles. But
now, more and more farmland is being sacrificed in developing countries with hungry populations, calling into question the
future role of the car. Millions of hectares of cropland in the industrial world have been paved over for roads and parking
lots. Each U.S. car, for example, requires on average 0.07 hectares of paved land for roads and parking space. For every
five cars added to the total number of cars in the U.S., an area the size of a football field is covered with asphalt. More
often than not, cropland is paved simply because the flat, welldrained soils that are well suited for farming are also ideal
for building roads. Once paved, land is not easily reclaimed. ",201610,blank,CSAT,UNK
"High language densities found in the tropics can hinder contact

tropics than at higher latitudes may in part explain a curious

feature of how languages are distributed: near the equator,
language densities (the number of languages per unit area) are
much higher, and language communities (the number of people
speaking a given language) very much smaller, than they are at
higher latitudes. One explanation for this might be that it is a
culturally evolved strategy to reduce the risk of crossinfection in
areas where pathogens are more densely concentrated.
Language barriers significantly reduce the opportunities for
contact between different populations, thus minimizing the risk
of contamination. Creating smaller, more inwardlooking,
xenophobic societies may thus help to reduce exposure to
diseases to which one has no natural immunity.",201610,topic,CSAT,UNK
What Does an Audience Mean to Performers?,"The absence of an audience has affected performers of all
types and traditions. Before the era of the phonograph,
Hindustani classical musicians not only took inspiration from
their listeners but also improvised directly in response to their
reactions. The exact sound and shape of the performance,
then, was determined in part by the interaction of artist and
audience. For those who recorded, one way to compensate
was to manufacture an audience, planting enthusiastic listeners
in the studio. On an acousticera recording of Maujuddin Khan,
for example, one can hear a few “plants” shouting “Wah! Wah!
Maujuddin Khan!” In a more recent example, I myself was an
unwitting plant in a recording session for the rock group
Rotoglow. After observing from the control room, I was invited
to sit in the studio while the band was recording. Squeezed
between the lead guitarist and the drummer, I was sure I was a
distraction, and after a few songs I volunteered to return to the
other side of the glass. To my surprise, the group insisted that I
stay. “You’re a part of this, man!” one of them declared. I hardly
acted like a typical rock concertgoer. I sat quietly in a chair, my
only actions consisting of taking notes and stuffing my ears with
wadded toilet paper. Nevertheless, my presence must
have in some way met the band’s need or desire for an
audience.",201610,topic,CSAT,UNK

effective ways to change bad study habits,"One might wonder whether there is any reason to be concerned
about overconfidence in students. After all, confidence is often
considered a positive trait. Indeed, research suggests that students
who are confident about their ability to succeed in school tend to
perform better on academic tests than those with less confidence.
That said, negative consequences also stem from being too
confident in the classroom. Students who are overconfident about
their ability to succeed in college end up feeling more disconnected
and disillusioned than those with more modest expectations.
Overconfidence can also leave students with mistaken impressions
that they are fully prepared for tests and no longer need to study.
Students who have relatively accurate perceptions regarding their
progress in learning tend to use more effective study habits and
perform better on tests than do those with more error-prone views of

A certain level of unavailability will make you more of a mystery and a challenge.,"People are attracted to individuals and things they cannot readily
obtain. In the case with things, people are more attracted to a desired
object because it is out of their reach. When the object of desire is
finally gained, the attraction for the object rapidly decreases. Christmas
presents provide a good example of this phenomenon. Toys children
wanted all year long are thrown away several days after they are taken
from gift boxes under the tree. The phenomenon also holds true for

Popularity Greatly Affects Product Success,"When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final

million copies in its first 24 hours on sale. Was the last Harry Potter
book that good? Perhaps it and the earlier six volumes were
genuinely brilliant─despite the fact that eight publishers declined to
publish the first volume. But although success is at least partly
determined by intrinsic quality, it is also possible that what people
come to like depends very much on what they believe others like.
In such a world, the explanation for why a particular book becomes
a hit may be as simple as this publisher’s: “It sold well because lots
of people bought it.” Because social information is now being shared much more
widely across virtual and actual borders than in the past, cultural
artifacts such as books and movies can now ‘snowball’ in
popularity in ways they could not a century ago, turning cultural
commerce into a collection of difficult-to-predict, winner-take-all

Reservoir Effect: Unintended Change in Earth’s Rotation,"We have constructed so many large reservoirs to hold water, and
they are located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere rather than
randomly around the globe. As a result, enough of Earth’s mass has
shifted to speed up its rotation. Currently, 88 huge reservoirs hold
some 10 trillion tons of water. Before the reservoirs were built, this
water was located in the ocean, which has most of its mass in the
Southern Hemisphere. The effect is like a whirling skater who pulls
her arms in to turn faster. Because natural factors in the
environment, such as the pull of tides, are gradually slowing Earth’s
rotation, the human influence is accidentally working against the
natural rate of deceleration. The shift in Earth’s mass has also

It is more useful for students to provide descriptive feedback than grades,"Studies show that narrative feedback on students’ performance is

formulating your main argument, but your body paragraphs don’t
address the question raised by the argument,” in response to a rough
draft of a paper, the student has information that praises the positive

this person what he or she is and different from everyone else. You
would find it very difficult indeed to describe the inside of your friend,

level of precision is clearly inappropriate. It is unlikely that all
British adults were surveyed, so the results are based only on a

their powder washes whiter than any other. Even if the whole

What Determines Species’ Survival,"Although organisms interact with their surroundings in many
ways, certain factors may be critical to a particular species’
success. A shortage or absence of this factor restricts the
success of the species; thus, it is known as a limiting factor.
Limiting factors can be quite different from one species to
another. The limiting factor for many species of fish is the amount of
dissolved oxygen in the water. In a swiftly flowing, tree-lined
mountain stream, the level of dissolved oxygen is high and so
provides a favorable environment for trout. As the stream
continues down the mountain, the steepness of the slope
decreases, which results in fewer rapids where the water
tumbles over rocks and becomes oxygenated. In addition, as the
stream becomes wider, the canopy of trees over the stream
usually is thinner, allowing more sunlight to reach the stream
and warm the water. Warm water cannot hold as much
dissolved oxygen as cool water. Therefore, slower-flowing,
warm-water streams contain less oxygen than rapidly moving,
cool streams. Fish such as black bass and walleye are adapted
to such areas, since they are able to tolerate lower oxygen
concentrations and higher water temperatures. Trout are not
able to survive under such conditions and are not found in warm,
less well-oxygenated water. Thus, low levels of oxygen and high
water temperatures are limiting factors for the distribution of
trout.",201611_2,topic,CSAT,UNK

experiences. Early humans communicated their ideas and experiences to others for thousands of years by drawing
pictures in the sand or on the walls of their caves. Only recently have humans created various languages and alphabets to
symbolize these “picture” messages. Your mind has not yet adapted to this relatively new development. An image has a
much greater impact on your brain than words; the nerves from the eye to the brain are twentyfive times larger than the
nerves from the ear to the brain. You often remember a person’s face but not his or her name.",201703,blank,CSAT,UNK

Limitations Are Advantages,"An artist or a child simply accepts whatever is in front of them
as tool, toy, or environment, and proceeds from that point. Part
of what is invigorating about the creative process is that it can
start from humble materials and poor beginnings. There is a
term in painting called “working with a limited palette;” a
deliberate choice to work with fewer colors than actually
available. With fewer options an artist can work more easily—
less colors actually inspire her to creative resolutions.
As a designer, I am often called upon to work with existing
elements: logos, color palettes, slogans, etc. I see these limits
as elements that actually help me; it is the limitations that help
me free my creative imagination.
Contemporary artist Vik Muniz uses everyday materials to
replicate classic artwork. He has used chocolate syrup to
render Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, and has recreated the
Mona Lisa with peanut butter and jelly. He uses what is around
him—from spaghetti to toy soldiers—as the “paint” for his

Knowledge: A Cornerstone for Cognitive Activities,"Appealing though it might be to offload the responsibility for teaching our students basic knowledge to their elementary

develop a rich body of knowledge in our content areas—without doing so, we handicap considerably their ability to engage
in cognitive activities like thinking and evaluating and creating. As cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham argued, you
can’t think creatively about information unless you have information in your head to think about. “Research from cognitive
science has shown,” he explained, “that the sorts of skills that teachers want for their students—such as the ability to
analyze and think critically—require extensive factual knowledge.” We have to know things, in other words, to think

Sniffing at an imaginary odor isn’t an absentminded habit—it’s a behavior that improves the mental image we are trying to create. ,"So closely is sniffing tied to odor perception that people routinely sniff when they are asked to imagine a smell. Without
prompting, they take larger sniffs when imagining pleasant odors and smaller ones when imagining malodors. During
visual imagery the eyes explore an imagined scene using the same scan paths made when viewing the actual visual
scene. Preventing eye movements during visual imagery—by having people stare at a stationary target—reduces the
quality of the image. Smell researcher Noam Sobel found that, similarly, imagined odors were more vivid when people
could sniff than when they were wearing nose clips and unable to sniff. Actually sniffing increased the unpleasantness of
an imagined bad smell (urine) and increased the pleasantness of a good one (flowers). ",201710,blank,CSAT,UNK
Researcher Timothy Carey and colleagues recently examined the idea that insights can be shortcuts to positive personal change. ,"People change over time, often for the better. Maturity, wisdom, patience, and many other strengths can result from the
gradual accumulation of life experiences. But do these qualities have to develop slowly? They conducted structured interviews with
people who had just finished psychotherapy. Reports of aha moments abounded. One interviewee said that he could
“visualize the point” at which he changed; another said, “I could actually hear it.” Many of them could identify the moment
at which they had their realizations, such as in a swimming pool with a spouse or in a particular meeting with a therapist.
Some used familiar metaphors to describe their ahas, such as a light being turned on, a button being pressed, a click, or a
“‘ping’ and then it was like I could see things clearly.” Personal growth doesn’t have to be a glacial process. As physician-
author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., wrote, “A moment’s insight is sometimes worth a life’s experience.”",201710,blank,CSAT,UNK

within one’s own mind for a model according to which reformed practice can be organized. Architects have long appealed
to a primitive hut as just such a model. It is a structure thought to provide access as close to the first principles of
architecture as it is possible to get, yet traces of this structure exist nowhere other than in the mind’s eye of the architect
searching for it. Nonetheless, absence of the primitive hut from physical reality does little to diminish its importance for the
renewal of present practices. If a desired (or required) thing resides in paradise, and no current map indicates its location,
getting to it will only be possible via dreams and wishes. Even though it is impossible to get there, returning to paradise nonetheless remains a

smaller than the other? The child’s drawings are not
reproductions of an optical image. He uses size to impart
emphasis and importance. He draws his concept of the object.
His drawing is consequently more meaningful than a faithful
reproduction. Objectivity can be achieved by photography.

Is TechnologyCentered Design Suitable for Humans?,"Traditionally, systems have been designed and developed
from a technologycentered perspective. Engineers developed
the sensors and systems that were needed to perform each
function. They then provided a display for each system that
informed the operator of how well that particular system was
operating or its present status. So, for example, in the aircraft
cockpit a separate display was provided for altitude, airspeed,
engine temperature, etc. As technology improved, more and
more displays were added. People were left with the job of
trying to keep pace with the dramatic growth of data created by
this process. In the face of changing tasks and situations, the
operator is called upon to find, sort, integrate, and process the
information that is needed from all that which is available,
leading inevitably to an information gap.
Unfortunately, the human has certain information processing
bottlenecks. People can only pay attention to a certain amount
of information at once. As the display of data in these systems
is centered around the technologies producing them, it is often
scattered and not ideally suited to support human tasks. A
considerable amount of additional work is required to find what
is needed and extra mental processing is required to calculate
the information the operator really wants to know. This
inevitably leads to higher than necessary workload and error.

The adults went home for a week, and recorded their thoughts in
a daily diary. Once a day they recalled the scenes from the
video that replayed in their minds. Those who had sat quietly
after watching the video experienced an average of six
flashbacks; those who had played the game experienced an
average of fewer than three. The video game, with its colors and
music and rotating blocks, prevented the initial traumatic
memories from solidifying . The game soaked up the mental attention that
might have otherwise moved those horrific memories to long-
term memory, and so they were stored imperfectly or not at all.

the neighborhood. After we spent a few minutes peering at rocks, alarm bells went off; my attention was pulled to an
unusual faint light flashing from a corner of a melonsized rock. My heart pounded hard. Experience in the field taught me
to respect the sensation triggered by these moments. I spent about five minutes curled up with the rock close to my eyes
before passing it to Farish for his expert opinion. Farish froze solid. His eyes shot back to me with a look of suppressed
emotion, disbelief, and surprise. “Yes, we found it!” I cried. Jumping with joy, I hugged him.",201810,atmosphere,CSAT,UNK

outofplace for the event, don’t immediately write that person off as a potential friend. This is a time in your life to dig
deeper and allow yourself to find out what makes people behave the way they do. Forget about surfaces and look for
what’s inside. And remember, it takes time for new friendships to develop. As you get to know each other, shared

"In a democratic environment, science helps to shape sound knowledge.","When science is examined as an enterprise that involves the values of independence, freedom, the right to dissent, and
tolerance, it is clear that as a social activity science cannot flourish in an authoritarian climate. Some philosophers of
science such as Bronowski claim that science cannot be practiced in authoritarian regimes. In a democratic environment,
old ideas can be challenged and rigorously criticized, although with some difficulty because of the human desire to hold
onto old ideas, especially by the original proposers. Yet it is the essence of scientific thinking to propose alternative ideas
and then to test them against existing concepts. As pointed out in an American Association for the Advancement of
Science report, Science for All Americans, “indeed, challenges to new ideas are the legitimate business of science in
building valid knowledge.”",201810,topic,CSAT,UNK
cultural reasons for people’s dislike for insects,"Considering the multitude of ways people benefit from insects, it is curious that insects continue to suffer from such an
unfavorable reputation. Ironically, while many of us perceive insects as harmful pests―dangerous, ugly, and disease-
ridden―in reality, without the service of pollination which they provide humankind might cease to exist. The promotion of
negative stereotypes of insects can be largely traced to failure by Europeans to appreciate or understand the customs of
the lands they colonized and their misperception that the way of life of most indigenous populations they encountered was
barbaric. Many people’s dislike for insects stems from a similar classist attitude that associates insects with indigenous
people who lack the means to buy or grow alternate sources of food. Again this prejudice stems largely from Western
cultures. In contrast, cultures of many Eastern nations such as Japan and China consider various species of insects to be
great delicacies.",201810,topic,CSAT,UNK
Under Undetectable Attack by Chemicals,"Through evolution, our brains have developed to deal with acute dangers, whether sabertoothed cats or thunderstorms.
Our nerve connections will ensure that we become aware of the dangers and react to them to protect ourselves, being
alerted by their peculiar smell, their threatening looks, or their scary noise. But nothing in our past has prepared us to deal
with the insidious chemical threats that endanger the development of the next generation’s brains. On the contrary, we are
thoroughly enjoying the immediate benefits of attractive consumer goods, efficient technologies, and handsome profits that
we generate from producing and disseminating hazardous chemicals. Our senses are not geared toward detecting the
underlying dangers. The irony is that the resulting harm to the brain may wipe out some of those senses that we badly
need to manage this very problem.",201810,topic,CSAT,UNK
"The flexibility of medicinal use makes the essential oils of special benefit to patients whose digestive systems have, for whatever reason, been
impaired.","One of the most satisfactory aspects of using essential oils medicinally and cosmetically is that they enter and leave the
body with great efficiency, leaving no toxins behind. The most effective way to use essential oils is not orally, as one might
think, but by external application or inhalation. The methods used include body oils, compresses, cosmetic lotions, baths,
hair rinses, inhalation (by steam, direct from the bottle or from a tissue), perfumes, room sprays, and a whole range of
room methods. Although under supervision the essential oils can be prescribed for oral ingestion, this is in fact their least
effective mode of entry because it involves their passing through the digestive system, where they come into contact with
digestive juices and other matter which affect their chemistry. This limitation also applies to any chemical medications.

"When it comes to the extent to which the volume of activity can be multiplied , contributions to political
campaigns and causes present a special case.","Political acts vary in terms of contribution. At one extreme, within limits, votes have equal weight. We are each allowed
only one per election contest. But the principle of one person, one vote does not obtain for other kinds of participation.
Individuals are free to write as many letters to public officials, work as many hours in campaigns, or join as many political
organizations as their time and commitment allow. Although there are no legal constraints on the number of phone calls a
citizen can make to public officials or the number of marches a protester can attend, the fact that there are only twentyfour

the person whose reciprocity is secured thanks to one’s compliance with the moral law,"Morality often expresses itself as a duty to perform an action that advances the interests of another, to the harm of one’s
own. However, moral actions usually do not occur in isolation, but rather as part of a generalized system of reciprocity
(one that stands at the core of the social order in every human society). This system of reciprocity generates benefits for
everyone involved (benefits such as freedom from worry of being robbed). If observance of one’s own duties represents
the price of admission into this generalized system of reciprocity, then it seems clear that respecting moral constraints also
generates benefits. The primary difference between morality and prudence is simply that, in the latter case, the longterm
benefits are secured through one’s own agency, whereas in the former case, they are mediated through the agency of
another.",201810,blank,CSAT,UNK
One of the greatest conceits practiced by research psychologists and other academics is that in studying people we often forget to ask them to personally weigh in on the topics being studied .,"The dictionary of course is not the last word on the definition of bravery. Philosophers have also advanced explanations
of this elusive concept, as have social scientists of all stripes. I’ll give you an example. For decades my
colleagues and I have studied happiness and the good life. We know all about how money does and does not affect
happiness and how happiness affects health, and we understand how happiness changes across the life cycle. But we
have rarely stepped back and taken the time to ask people to define, for themselves, what they consider the good life to
be! The same is true of courage. There are studies of how levels of courage differ from nation to nation and of how
frequently women experience courage. Still, relatively few people have stopped to ask people what they think courage is.",201810,blank,CSAT,UNK
"According to statistics, there have been boosts in the market

video and computer game hardware and software today stands
at about ten billion dollars annually and has risen continuously
for the past several years. Digital games―the term that covers
both video games and computer games―have long been the
preserve of the young, but that distinction is fading. This is
apparently not the sort of thing one gives up as one grows up;
people born after 1980 seem to continue their gaming with
more sophisticated and emotionally involved products.
Consistent with this, industry statistics indicate that the average
age of video gamers is rising by about one year each year. It is
already in the thirties right now. People may change the kinds

Humans: Too Adaptive to Feel Happier,"A fundamental trait of human nature is its incredible capacity
for adaptation. In the realm of human psychology, research
has long noted the essential trait of adapting to life’s events,
whether happy or tragic. Whatever the hardship a person may
experience, the indicators of satisfaction quickly return to their
initial levels.
A person seems to get used to everything, which is both
reassuring and depressing. Thus across time and space, the
percentages of happy and unhappy people are remarkably
unstable. This is obviously mainly due to humans’
astonishing capacity of adaptation and imitation. Any wealth or
any progress is relative, and quickly dissolves in a comparison
with others. When millionaires are asked about the size of the
fortune necessary to make them feel ‘truly at ease’, they all
respond in the same way, whatever the level of income they
have already attained: they need double what they already
possess! The heart of the problem is that people do not
anticipate their own capacity to adapt. They think that they
might be happy if they were given (a little) more and then they
would be satisfied, but they are not. The rise in income to come
always makes one dream, although once it is achieved, this
rise is never sufficient. For people compare their future
income to their current aspirations, without taking into account
the inevitable evolution of the aspirations. This is the principal
key to the vain quest for happiness.",201810,topic,CSAT,UNK

"To prevent delays, don't take unplanned breaks.","Breaks are necessary to revive your energy levels and recharge your
mental stamina, but they shouldn’t be taken carelessly. If you’ve
planned your schedule effectively, you should already have
scheduled breaks at appropriate times throughout the day, so any
other breaks in the midst of ongoing work hours are unwarranted.

While scheduled breaks keep you on track by being strategic, re-
energizing methods of self-reinforcement, unscheduled breaks derail

you from your goal, as they offer you opportunities to procrastinate
by making you feel as if you’ve got “free time.” Taking unscheduled
breaks is a sure-fire way to fall into the procrastination trap. You may
rationalize that you’re only getting a cup of coffee to keep yourself
alert, but in reality, you’re just trying to avoid having to work on a task
at your desk. So to prevent procrastination, commit to having no

"As long as the basic needs are met, happiness is not proportional to any more income.","A Princeton study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman found
that once a person earns $75,000 per year, the emotional benefits of
income wear off. He analyzed more than 450,000 responses to the
Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 U.S.
residents conducted by the Gallup Organization, and discovered that
emotional well-being rises with income—but not beyond an annual
income of $75,000. What is the significance of $75,000? It’s not a
magic number. It appears to be the income considered “adequate” to
meet people’s basic needs. And the researchers found that lower
income did not in itself cause sadness, but made people feel more
burdened by the problems they already had. In other words, that old
saying “money can’t buy happiness” turns out to be true.",201811,opinion,CSAT,UNK
factors contributing to longer life expectancy,"It turns out that the secret behind our recently extended life span is
not due to genetics or natural selection, but rather to the relentless
improvements made to our overall standard of living. From a medical
and public health perspective, these developments were nothing less
than game changing. For example, major diseases such as
smallpox, polio, and measles have been eradicated by mass
vaccination. At the same time, better living standards achieved
through improvements in education, housing, nutrition, and sanitation
systems have substantially reduced malnutrition and infections,
preventing many unnecessary deaths among children. Furthermore,
technologies designed to improve health have become available to
the masses, whether via refrigeration to prevent spoilage or
systemized garbage collection, which in and of itself eliminated many
common sources of disease. These impressive shifts have not only
dramatically affected the ways in which civilizations eat, but also
determined how civilizations will live and die.",201811,topic,CSAT,UNK
Appreciate What You Have Without Unrealistic Expectations,"Do you have a tendency to focus more on what you don’t have than
on what you do? Unfortunately, many people tend to focus on what
they don’t have, when in reality they are sitting on a pile of blessings!
Unrealistic expectations and comparisons to others lead to jealousy.
Being envious of what others have only serves to make you unhappy
with what you personally have. It’s hard to be grateful when all you
can think about is what you don’t have or think you should get.
Oftentimes frustration and dissatisfaction are actually the result of
unrealistic expectations on our part. We think our situation should be
this way or that way, or at least different from the way it is. Gratitude
is not about expectations, but about being thankful for our situation
no matter what our expectations may be.",201811,topic,CSAT,UNK
A good many scientists and artists have noticed the universality of creativity.,"At the Sixteenth Nobel Conference, held in 1980, scientists, musicians,
and philosophers all agreed, to quote Freeman Dyson, that “the
analogies between science and art are very good as long as you are
talking about the creation and the performance. The creation is
certainly very analogous. The aesthetic pleasure of the craftsmanship
of performance is also very strong in science.” A few years later, at
another multidisciplinary conference, physicist Murray Gell-Mann found
that “everybody agrees on where ideas come from. We had a seminar
here, about ten years ago, including several painters, a poet, a couple
of writers, and the physicists. Everybody agrees on how it works. All of
these people, whether they are doing artistic work or scientific work,
are trying to solve a problem.”",201811,blank,CSAT,UNK
"Both Sigmund Freud and the early behaviorists
led by John B. Watson believed that humans were motivated primarily
by selfish drives.","For several years much research in psychology was based on the
assumption that human beings are driven by base motivations such as
aggression, egoistic self-interest, and the pursuit of simple pleasures.
Since many psychologists began with that assumption, they
inadvertently designed research studies that supported their own
presuppositions. Consequently, the view of humanity that prevailed in
psychology was that of a species barely keeping its aggressive
tendencies in check and managing to live in social groups more out of
motivated self-interest than out of a genuine affinity for others or a true
sense of community. From that perspective, social interaction is possible only by
exerting control over those baser emotions and, therefore, it is always
vulnerable to eruptions of violence, greed, and selfishness. The fact
that humans actually live together in social groups has traditionally
been seen as a tenuous arrangement that is always just one step away
from violence.",201811,blank,CSAT,UNK

Inventory—a database of toxic emissions from US manufacturing
facilities—results in an average 3% increase in a firm’s financial

"Scientific knowledge cannot account for correct aesthetic appreciation of nature because science represents natural
objects as members of a specific class, rather than as individual entities.","The science-based approach claims that aesthetically relevant
properties are only those properties that all members of a natural kind
share with each other. But this is not true. When we experience nature,
we do not experience it as species, but as individual objects. And as
separated into individual objects, nature can have aesthetic properties
that are not entailed by its scientific description. Natural science can
explain, for instance, the formation of the waterfall, but it has nothing to
say about our experience of the majestic Victoria Falls when viewed at
sunset, its reds and oranges countless and captivating; geology can
explain the formation of the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, but not its
painful and breathtaking beauty at sunrise, the fog slowly lifting above
the crater and a lone hippopotamus dark and heavy in the lake.",201811,blank,CSAT,UNK

Blockchain Technology Is a Double-Edged Sword,"While complex, blockchains exhibit a set of core characteristics,
which flow from the technology’s reliance on a peer-to-peer
network, public-private key cryptography, and consensus
mechanisms. Blockchains are disintermediated and
transnational. They are resilient and resistant to change, and
enable people to store nonrepudiable data, pseudonymously, in
a transparent manner. Most—if not all—blockchain-based
networks feature market-based or game-theoretical mechanisms
for reaching consensus, which can be used to coordinate people
or machines. These characteristics, when combined, enable the
deployment of autonomous software and explain why
blockchains serve as a powerful new tool to facilitate economic
and social activity that otherwise would be difficult to achieve.
At the same time, these characteristics represent the
technology’s greatest limitations. The disintermediated and transnational
nature of blockchains makes the technology difficult to govern
and makes it difficult to implement changes to a blockchain’s
underlying software protocol. Because blockchains are
pseudonymous and have a tamper-resistant data structure
supported by decentralized consensus mechanisms, they can
be used to coordinate socially unacceptable or criminal conduct,
including conduct facilitated by autonomous software programs.
Moreover, because blockchains are transparent and traceable,
they are prone to being co-opted by governments or
corporations, transforming the technology into a powerful tool for
surveillance and control.",201811,topic,CSAT,UNK
